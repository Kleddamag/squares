"""Audit, sample and price wand125's independent run of ValidTilt9.

T-081's lower half at every ``k >= 8`` rests on ValidTilt9: every closed unit square in
``[0, 9]^2`` with centre in ``[0, 9/2]^2`` and angle ``theta = 2 arctan u``, ``u > 0``,
``u^2 + 2u <= 1``, has mass at least 1 under Evan Daniel's box cover ``K4_k008_box9.txt``.
Daniel's ``qx2_zm.py`` decides it in the source's run; wand125/valid7-independent-check
at ``c561dbb3`` reports a second decision by wand125's separately written checker, the
one whose Valid7 run this repository replayed for T-064. Its run is published as three
JSON-lines records in the release ``records-tilt9-v1``, pinned by SHA-256 in the
2026-10-06 packet and not retained, so every subcommand that reads them takes the
directory of the downloaded ``.jsonl.gz`` files.

``audit --records DIR [--out JSON]``
    Checks what the source's ``check_record.py --claim tilt`` leaves out, and reads
    nothing it writes: each file, compressed and decompressed, has the digest of the
    retained ``release/records.sha256``; each header names the cover the evand packet
    retains and checker files this packet retains, by SHA-256; the roots of the three
    records are exactly the 45 x 45 x 14 grid over centres ``[0, 9/2]^2`` and ``u`` in
    ``[0, 7/16]``, each once, split by centre ``x`` as ``MERGE.md`` says; that grid covers
    the statement's region, ``7/16 > sqrt 2 - 1``; no root has an uncertified box or a
    counterexample; the leaf counts and CPU are the README's; and each root's leaves are
    consistent with the driver options ``MERGE.md`` and the run notes give for its place
    in its record (`PHASES`).
``stage --work DIR``
    Copies the retained checker and the decompressed cover into ``DIR/v1`` and
    ``DIR/v2``, one for each driver the run used, refusing any file whose SHA-256 is not
    the one the records' headers name.
``sample --records DIR --per-phase N [--heavy H] [--seed S] [--max-seconds T] [--python P]``
    Chooses up to ``N`` light roots of each phase, those of at most ``T`` recorded
    seconds, spread over the phase's recorded cost, and ``H`` heavy roots spread over
    the rest. It writes, for each light root, the command that re-runs that one root
    with its phase's driver and options (``replay``), and for a root of an earlier phase
    also the command under the last phase's options (``final``); a heavy root is re-run
    under the last phase's options only.
``run --sample JSON --work DIR [--jobs J] [--stratum light|heavy]``
    Runs the sampled commands in the staged work dirs, ``J`` at a time, each under
    ``devtools.replay_receipt``; a run whose receipt passed is not run again.
``compare --records DIR --sample JSON --work DIR [--out JSON]``
    Reads each sampled run's record and receipt: the header names the staged files; the
    argv sets exactly the phase's options; the run holds the one published root, with no
    uncertified box and no counterexample, and for a ``replay`` run the published leaf
    list; and the receipt ends with exit 0. It then prices a full replay: each phase's
    and stratum's recorded CPU times the ratio of this host's receipt CPU to the recorded
    CPU over its sample (`price`), once as published (``replay``) and once under the
    last phase's options (``final``). A run under its root's own options is a replay
    whatever its mode (`replays`). It also counts the distinct roots re-decided and the
    share of the run's recorded cost they hold.

``control --work DIR [--python P]``
    Writes two covers each lighter by a relative ``1e-4`` on one tight family (`mutants`)
    into ``DIR/v2/cover`` and runs the checker's own entry points on them and on the
    original: Tier B on a box at the wall family must accept the original and refuse M1,
    and the driver on roots inside the Lebesgue square must verify the original and
    find a counterexample under M2.

It decides nothing about a leaf: the checker does. From ``packing/``::

    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.audit_validtilt9_independent \\
