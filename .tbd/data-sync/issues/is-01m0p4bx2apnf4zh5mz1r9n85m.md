Runnable TODAY against the existing engine, unlike most of the strategy register. Perturb Trump's exact configuration by uniform noise of size eps, measure the fraction of runs returning within 1e-6, sweeping eps over 1e-5..1e-1 with 40 runs each. The eps at which the return rate collapses IS the basin width in the units the search moves in, so a refutation is as quantitative as a confirmation. Re-run after the LP quench lands: 'does the refiner hold the cell' is a sharper question than 'does the annealer wander back'.
