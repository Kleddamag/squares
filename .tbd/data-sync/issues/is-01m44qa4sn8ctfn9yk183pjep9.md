**A1 (Medium): no gate exercises the native path.**
- All the FFI and Job-object lifecycle code (`devtools/supervise_windows.py`, about 821 lines of ctypes) is covered only by 3 Windows-only tests, which skip on Linux (`tests/test_supervise_windows.py:136`).
- The acceptance evidence is the author's local receipts. This conflicts with OR-13.
- **Fix:** add a small `windows-latest` CI job for the 3 native tests (about 3 s), or state explicitly that native acceptance is not gated.

Authorized maintenance only. Disposition requires evidence and exact-head CI; no research follow-up reserved.
