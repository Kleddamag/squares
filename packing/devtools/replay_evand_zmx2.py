"""Build Evan Daniel's ``zmx2`` from retained bytes and replay a mixed or point cover.

Stage 4 of the result import process replays the source's own checker on the retained
bytes (``campaign/result-import.md``). For the covers in Daniel's format that checker is
the Rust ``zmx2``, and every input it needs is retained here: its source at the version a
run's manifest names, the crate files it builds with, and the cover. This tool assembles
them in a scratch directory, refusing any file whose SHA-256 is not the one the record
states, builds the binary with ``cargo``, and runs ``zmx2 cert`` under
``devtools.replay_receipt``, so every run leaves a receipt in one shape.

``build --checker 6b7f0f79|92a4cfe8 --work DIR``
    Writes ``DIR/<checker>/verify2/`` and builds ``target/release/zmx2``; the receipt is
    ``DIR/<checker>/build.log``. Rebuilding an existing directory is a no-op apart from
    re-checking the digests.
``run --case N --mode d4|full --work DIR --out OUT [--threads T] [--x LO-HI] [--y LO-HI]``
    Runs the case's cover with the flags its source used (``CASES``), writing the
    receipt ``OUT/<name>.log`` and the root log ``OUT/<name>_roots.log``. ``--x`` and
    ``--y`` restrict the root region, so one sweep can be split across machines; the
    region is in the file name. ``--time-limit S`` stops the run after ``S`` seconds
    with exit 3, so a session can push partial receipts. Running the same command again
    resumes from the root log, which ``zmx2`` reads before it starts, so an interrupted
    run loses at most the roots in flight; the resumed run writes
    ``<name>_resume<k>.log`` beside the first receipt. ``zmx2`` itself exits 0 whatever
    its verdict, so the verdict is read from the receipt (``REGION CLEAN``,
    ``VERIFIED``, ``NOT VERIFIED``, ``INCOMPLETE``).
``control --case N --mutation KIND --work DIR --out OUT [--mode M] [--x LO-HI] [--y LO-HI]``
    Stage 4's negative control: stages a mutated copy of the case's cover (``mutate``)
    and runs the same ``zmx2 cert`` on it over a small root region where the mutation is
    refused, writing ``OUT/<name>_control_<KIND>_zmx2_...log`` and its root log. Each
    mutation in ``MUTATIONS`` removes whole D4 orbits or scales every mass, so a
    D4-invariant cover stays invariant and ``--d4`` still applies. The mode and region
    default to the retained control's (``CONTROLS``). The receipt's ``cwd`` line names
    the mutated cover's SHA-256 beside the retained one's and the mass removed; a
    retained control must read ``NOT VERIFIED`` with uncertified boxes, which
    ``tests/test_replay_controls.py`` holds.

What a run decides is read afterwards by ``devtools.audit_evand_mixed_covers``. This
tool decides nothing about a cover: it only guarantees which bytes were run.

It imports only the standard library and ``devtools.replay_receipt``, so it runs under
any CPython from 3.11 and needs no project environment, which is what a fresh cloud
batch session has. From ``packing/``::

    python3 -m devtools.replay_evand_zmx2 build --checker 6b7f0f79 --work /tmp/zmx2
    python3 -m devtools.replay_evand_zmx2 run --case 77 --mode full --x 45-89 \\
        --work /tmp/zmx2 --out /tmp/zmx2/out --threads 4
