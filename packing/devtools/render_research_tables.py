"""Render the research documents' data tables from the structured sources.

The tables are duplicated deliberately: a reader should get the whole picture
from the report alone, without opening the data. Duplication is only safe if it
cannot drift, so the Markdown between the GENERATED markers is written from
`frontier/` rather than by hand.

`--check` compares parsed cells, not bytes, so it is unaffected by the
Markdown formatter reflowing the surrounding prose. Rendering answers to the
same comparison: a row that still says what the document says is written back
unchanged, so a run over an unchanged tree produces an empty diff.
