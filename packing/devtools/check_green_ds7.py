"""Check the point pattern behind Green's DS7 Theorem 9, and whether it is unavoidable.

Friedman's survey DS7 states Theorem 9, from Trevor Green's private communication of
2000, and gives no proof:

    s(k^2 + 1) >= G_k = 2 sqrt 2 - 1 + (k (k - 1)^2 + (k - 1) sqrt(2k)) / (k^2 + 1).

Its Figure 34 draws sixteen points for ``k = 4`` and calls them an unavoidable set.
DS7's Section 5 says what that means: a set ``P`` is unavoidable in the closed square
``S`` when every closed unit square inside ``S`` contains a point of ``P``, possibly on
its boundary; shrinking ``P`` by ``1 - eps/L`` then puts a point in the interior of every
unit square in a square of side ``L - eps``, so ``k^2`` points unavoidable at side ``G_k``
prove ``s(k^2 + 1) >= G_k``.

wand125's write-up of 2026-10-02 (jlevy/squares#308, retained under
``resources/web/wand125-green-ds7-theorem9-2026-10-02``) reconstructs the pattern for
every ``k``, and MacIver's manuscript of August 2026 gives the same one for ``k = 4``:
``k`` rows at heights ``m_y + j t``, even rows at offsets ``0, u, u + 1, ..., u + k - 2``
and odd rows at ``0, 1, ..., k - 2, u + k - 2`` from ``m_x``, with

    t = (k (k - 1) + sqrt(2k)) / (k^2 + 1),   u = (k sqrt(2k) - (k - 1)) / (k^2 + 1),
    m_x = sqrt 2 - t/2,                       m_y = sqrt 2 - 1/2.

For each ``k`` asked, this tool checks:

- **That the pattern reproduces G_k.** ``t^2 + u^2 = 1``, ``k t - u = k - 1``, and the
  width ``2 m_x + u + k - 2`` and height ``2 m_y + (k - 1) t`` both equal DS7's ``G_k``,
  as exact identities. It counts the mesh edges of displacement ``(+-(1 - u), t)``
  between neighbouring rows, of length ``d = sqrt(2 - 2u)``, and decides ``d <= 1``,
  DS7 Lemma 3's hypothesis for the triangles they bound, and ``m_x <= 1``, without which
  a strip of width one along a side wall holds no point.
- **The write-up's empty square** ``Q_k`` (``k >= 4``), centred at the midpoint of the
  long edge from ``A = (u + 1, 0)`` to ``D = (2, t)`` with sides along it, and at
  ``k = 4`` the square the write-up publishes, each against every point and every wall.
- **An independent search.** By DS7 Lemma 3 the centre of an empty unit square lies in a
  mesh triangle with a side longer than one, or outside the mesh. The search runs a
  compass search of the clearance from poses in all of those regions, in floating point,
  and hands its best pose to the same exact check. A search that finds nothing proves
  nothing.
- **A certificate where nothing escapes** (``--certify``). The pattern, scaled to a
  rational side a little below ``G_k`` and rounded to the grid of
  ``cases.green17.interval_audit``, goes to that module's exhaustive branch-and-bound,
  which certifies that every closed unit square in the container contains a point or
  refuses. The certified set is the rounded one, within ``1e-18`` of the scaled pattern,
  and proves ``s(k^2 + 1)`` at least its side. At ``G_k`` itself the pattern is tight --
  DS7 Lemma 2 holds with equality at the walls -- and a rational branch-and-bound cannot
  close a family of zero width on irrational coordinates.

**Exactness.** Every coordinate lies in ``Q(sqrt 2, sqrt k)`` and is held as a finite
sum of rational multiples of square roots of distinct squarefree integers (`Surd`).
Square roots of distinct squarefree integers are linearly independent over the
rationals (Besicovitch, 1940), so such a sum is zero exactly when every coefficient is,
and the sign of a nonzero one is decided by integer square-root enclosures refined until
they exclude zero. A checked square has a `Surd` centre and a rational rotation,
``cos = (1 - tau^2)/(1 + tau^2)``, ``sin = 2 tau/(1 + tau^2)`` for a rational ``tau``, so
``cos^2 + sin^2 = 1`` holds exactly and every quantity compared is a `Surd`. Floating
point chooses where to look; it decides nothing.

**Conventions.** A square *fits* when it lies in the closed container ``[0, G_k]^2``, so
touching a wall is allowed, and *contains* a point lying in the closed square, so a point
on its boundary counts. An *empty* square is a fitting square with every point strictly
outside it. That is the hardest form of the claim to refute: it refutes DS7's
unavoidability with boundary points counted, and, because the reported clearances are
positive, every shrunk or open variant as well. ``ceiling`` bounds the largest side at
which the pattern, scaled, is unavoidable: an empty square of half side ``h > 1/2`` is
found and checked, so the scaled pattern fails at every side from ``G_k/(2h)`` up.
