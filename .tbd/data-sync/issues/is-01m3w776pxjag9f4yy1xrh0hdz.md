Owner, 2026-10-01: 'you have full control you have gh access and gh stack is installed'; 'read the tbd github stack instructions and github cli instructions'. Read (tbd shortcut stacked-prs; gh stack merge --help) and applied: 'gh stack merge 271 --yes --merge' landed #266 and #271 atomically (main c1f1b2751); #270 was not linked into the stack on GitHub (its base had been set with gh pr edit), so it was retargeted to main and merged with gh pr merge (main 7f1ad844e). For later stacks: create and link them with gh stack so gh stack merge covers every layer; never the bare REST merge call.
