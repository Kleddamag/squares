    control: The float pre-screen placed the endpoint's own state (its positive control) and no other draw
      (receipts/A/survey-seed182.json). The kernel on the endpoint's own state, which is feasible at U, at a
      2,700 s ceiling must not close; it returned PASS_CERTIFIED_STALL in 333 s (receipts/A/kernel-control-endpoint.json).
    candidate: Each draw's seed and node, re-proved in full by the standing kernel verifier on a closure.

    operator: Claude Session 182; the run operator's lane A queue ran the survey, the control and the draws two

  verdict:

    reason: >-
      Five of the ten counted draws closed within the 7,000 s ceiling, each re-proved in full
      by the standing kernel verifier, which meets the criterion of at least half; every
      closure cost under 900 s of process CPU and every verification under 700 s, far inside
      two CPU-hours. The other five counted draws reached producer fixed points inside the
      ceiling, as did both distance-2 draws. The W2 factual review
      (docs/project/reviews/review-2026-10-05-exp-252-h264.md) confirmed the verdict with
      corrections to bookkeeping and attribution, which this record carries.

# exp-252: Session 182 Lane A, the Per-State Price

[H-264](../../../hypotheses/H-264-n17-geometric-exclusion-cost-per-leaf.md), as
rewritten in Session 182’s registration, asks what fraction of a seeded draw of residue
orbits the 17-owner kernel excludes by a certificate the standing verifier re-proves,
and at what cost per state.
This round is lane A of the
[n17 overnight plan](../../../../../docs/project/specs/active/plan-2026-10-05-n17-overnight.md)
(BC-419). All twelve draws have run.

## Verdict

The criterion is met: five of the ten counted draws closed within N1’s 7,000 s ceiling,
and the standing verifier re-proved each in full, so the falsifier (fewer than half) did
not fire.
A closed state cost 352 to 869 s of process CPU and its verification 151 to 676
s; the five counted states that did not close each reached a producer fixed point in 634
to 1,297 s, well inside the ceiling, so more time would not have closed them under this
recipe (H-274 asks whether adaptive rows close the first four; index 6 stalled after it
was registered). The wall of 12,041 s runs from the survey’s start at 08:46 UTC to the
last draw’s receipt at 12:07 UTC, through a container restart at 10:32 UTC; the verdict
was fixed at the fifth verification, at 12:02 UTC. The
[W2 factual review](../../../../../docs/project/reviews/review-2026-10-05-exp-252-h264.md)
the plan requires before X-048 or the frontier states the verdict confirmed it, with
corrections to bookkeeping and attribution (its F1 to F4, applied here) and one gap, the
extrapolation over the drawn strata (its F5, below).
All twelve draws have run: the last counted draw (index 6) and the distance-2 draw at
index 9 reached producer fixed points too.

## Extrapolation Over the Drawn Strata

H-264 asks what the closures extrapolate to over the frame’s drawn strata, and requires
the strata the draw does not reach to be reported as unsampled.
The survey’s strata cross corners, interior cells and distance to the endpoint’s orbit;
its receipt (receipts/A/survey-seed182.json) gives each stratum’s size.
The ten counted draws come from 8 strata holding 1,354 of the frame’s 2,255 non-endpoint
orbits:

| Stratum | Orbits | Counted draws | Closed | Process CPU per state, mean |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| c3/i4/d4 | 182 | 2 | 1 | 752 s |
| c3/i<=3/d4 | 64 | 1 | 0 | 828 s |
| c4/i4/d4 | 258 | 2 | 1 | 824 s |
| c4/i<=3/d4 | 135 | 1 | 0 | 828 s |
| c4/i>=5/d4 | 86 | 1 | 1 | 545 s |
| c3/i4/d6 | 253 | 1 | 1 | 594 s |
| c4/i4/d6 | 249 | 1 | 0 | 925 s |
| c4/i>=5/d6 | 127 | 1 | 1 | 396 s |

Weighting each stratum’s closed share by its size gives a point estimate of about 686 of
those 1,354 orbits closing under this recipe, about half, and a size-weighted mean of
about 730 s of process CPU per state run.
The statement is bounded, and holds per stratum.
Six of the eight strata rest on a single draw, so each of their shares is 0 or 1, and
the other two rest on two draws.
The estimate is a description of these draws scaled to the strata they came from, not a
measured closure rate for any stratum.
The draw is weighted toward distances 2 and 4 (Sainte-Laguë weights 4 and 2), so the raw
5 of 10 is not a frame-wide rate either; the verdict does not depend on that rate, since
the criterion counts draws.

The two distance-2 draws, reported apart, come from 2 strata holding 74 orbits (c4/i4/d2
and c4/i<=3/d2); neither closed.

**Unsampled:** 21 strata holding 827 orbits, reported as unsampled and not extrapolated:
430 orbits in the 9 strata at distance 8 or more, and 397 in 12 strata at distances 2 to
6 (c3/i4/d2 13, c3/i<=3/d2 8, c3/i>=5/d4 46, c3/i>=5/d6 52, c3/i<=3/d6 70, c4/i<=3/d6
82, and the six strata with at most two corners, 126 between them).
H-264’s regime gave the unsampled set as “every distance-8-or-more stratum, 430 of 2,256
orbits”, which holds only if strata are read as distance bands; under the survey’s own
strata it understates the unsampled set by 397 orbits.
No price for the residue tail is claimed: the tail includes the unsampled 827 orbits,
and the drawn strata carry too few draws each to price it.

State 5500414’s orbit was already excluded by SW9’s certificate (flag 3, arity 9,
admitted in exp-250), so its admission leaves the count unchanged, while states 7844815,
4028335 and 2601983 each remove their own orbit.
With all five closures admitted, the certified census counts 72,272 states in 9,165
orbits, the endpoint surviving
([census](../results/exp-252-n17-overnight-per-state-price/census.json)).

The draws run in the survey’s own seeded random order (indices 2, 4, 1, 5, 8, 10, 3, 12,
11, 6, 7, 9). The receipt’s `index` field is the stratified draw position, not that
order. Wall exceeds process CPU by up to about 2.5 times here (1.9 times over the 13
kernel runs) because other agents’ test runs held the host at a load near 10; the
per-state price is read from process CPU.

The receipts are under
[receipts/A](../../../explorations/X048-session-182-overnight/receipts/A/), the admitted
certificate’s small files under the X048 certificates folder, and its objects in the
[hosted-data manifest](../../../../hosted/n17-x048-session-168-certificates.yaml).
