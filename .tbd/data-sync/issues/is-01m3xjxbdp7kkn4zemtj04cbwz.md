From X-049 (think-31v0, think-ea3f). The prototype devtools.regularize_axis_components produces exact derived views (verified twice over Q at the certificate's side) that cut the atlas's light green squares at the six named cases from 545 to 242 under the house rule, with no change of side. The census lists 2,453 regularizable squares in 54 records. Build it as a layer, never a witness change: a regularized pose per decimal record under its own directory, a manifest field naming it, a --check comparing digests (outside the fast gate: about 20-40 serial minutes), and a workbench/atlas toggle drawing it with a 'regularized' badge. Prerequisites named by the lane: a neighbour non-regression rule (at 206 two near-axis squares lost a contact when a neighbour moved), a separate colour class for squares tilted by hundredths of a degree instead of straightening them, and a decision for algebraic-field witnesses (same algorithm in Q(alpha), not prototyped) and interval-enclosure witnesses (no exact lattice statement). Also: the atlas legend says shade = full-side contacts but not that a light square can be loose optimizer output rather than short of neighbours; add one sentence.

## Notes

2026-10-02 session-168: layer built and pushed (PR 305, 22bfdb843). Done: non-regression rule (house and stage), --update-atlas/--check-atlas/--verify-atlas, 51 records regularized (all 50 packets + n=26), 89 Kingbird refused (promotion-overlap at dilation 1) and n=69 (decimal corners), atlas light green 7,725 -> 5,475 with none lighter; --check-atlas in the records tier; workbench stage legend row and homepage ATLAS_SHADE_KEY sentence. Remaining: (1) homepage House/Regularized toggle per the design note (renderings under atlas/known-best/regularized/rendering/, a third tile template with a badge, atlas-grid.js swap with ?layer=, tests in test_overview.py, test_site_atlas_views.py, measure_atlas_views) -- needs a host whose Playwright build matches the pin; (2) wire --verify-atlas (~313 s) into a deferred checkpoint and document it in development.md's validation table; (3) decide whether a view may use the smallest verifying dilation, which would open the 89 Kingbird records.

2026-10-02 session-168 phase 6 (commit 6200bcf23): (1) homepage Atlas drawings toggle built: ?layer=regularized swaps the 51 regularized cases to badged tiles drawn by the house renderer; devtools.render_regularized_atlas draws them from index.json and its --check is the records-tier step 'regularized atlas drawings match their index'. (2) --verify-atlas is the deferred step 'regularized atlas views re-derive exactly' in its own regularized-views job (about 800 cpu-seconds, not 313 s; 223 s at four workers), with a 450 s derived ceiling in gate-budgets.yaml that names this bead as owner of the first hosted measurement. (3) Smallest verifying dilation measured over the 89 refused Kingbird records: all verify at 1+1e-31..1+1e-27, but 75 views would sit below the register's verified upper bound (a tier promotion) and 14 would enlarge the container, for a gain of two squares; the refusal stays, recorded in the atlas README. Remaining: replace the 450 s derived ceiling with the first hosted regularized-views measurement, then close.
