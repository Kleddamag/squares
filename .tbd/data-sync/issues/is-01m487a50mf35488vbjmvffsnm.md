Stage 4's review lane for the machine check of Karakuş's Proposition 5.1 (T-083, T-084, #295). Lane R6 could not run it: launching `claude -p` as the separately prompted reviewer was refused by its session's permission classifier ("Create Unsafe Agents"), so the replay lane is done and the exit is staged, not merged.

What exists (lane R6, branch claude/ecstatic-pascal-pothtx-r6, not pushed):
- d7f2c6186 on the lane branch: packing/devtools/check_karakus_strip_measure.py, packing/tests/test_karakus_strip_measure.py, and the receipt packing/campaign/series/series-000-smoke-and-calibration/results/karakus-strip-measure/receipt.json (5,939-leaf exact Fraction cover, depth 34, 4 corner leaves; 3 mutated measures refused with counterexamples).
- The staged exit on branch claude/ecstatic-pascal-pothtx-r6-exit: 28ffccc7c (E-karakus-strip-measure-interval, V-check-karakus-strip-measure, T-083 and T-084 to V3/C3, 203 case records, the case generator, the stage's citation lines, rendered views) and b5778dbbe (re-pin).

How to finish:
1. Run the review as the brief describes: `claude -p --agent tbd-strong --model claude-opus-5-5` in its own detached worktree at d7f2c6186, blind to the exit commit. It reads Section 5 of packing/resources/papers/karakus-2026-counterexample-nagamochi-scoring-lemma.md and the checker; checks that the decided statement plus the hand reductions in the module docstring imply Proposition 5.1 as stated (open versus closed, orientations, the point-row argument, the case split by which strip lines cut, reflection and central symmetry, b near 3, what 101/100 is used for); checks every enclosure and rule (tau monotonicity, per-cell bounds, the row rule, margin, area and corner rules with lambda = 1 in a box, the tree replay, the sympy identities); runs the checker and its test; decides something independently with its own code; says what rung the evidence supports for T-083 and T-084 under epistemics.md; lists findings blocking or not.
2. Store its output byte-identical under docs/project/reviews/ (with a .flowmarkignore entry, as the other byte-identical reviews have), map it in docs/project/document-map.yaml, and list it in T-083's and T-084's `reviews` (kind adversarial, relation project).
3. If it has no blocking finding: merge the exit branch (or cherry-pick 28ffccc7c and b5778dbbe), re-render, re-pin. If it has one: fix the checker, rerun `--update`, and redo the exit.
4. #295 is then closeable (check_requests --report on the exit branch: "Closeable: yes, with a final comment").

Expected CPU: the checker's replay is about 4 s; the review lane, its own budget.
What refutes: a box the checker closes by an unsound rule, or a gap in the hand reduction.
