close_reason: "Done: the bead itself records the decision as RESOLVED by measurement and written into the toolkit plan (docs/project/specs/active/plan-2026-08-22-minimal-packing-toolkit.md, 'Stack and boundaries'); the one open sub-decision belongs to Phase 5, think-u83z."

RESOLVED by measurement, kept for the record and for the one open sub-decision. The pipeline was priced: annealer move 0.025us, ctypes call 0.52us, JSONL round-trip 18.3us, LP quench 1283us, exact verify 129000us. Transport speed decides nothing - at candidate granularity ctypes is 0.04% of a quench and JSONL 1.4%. Decision: sqsearch stays a native binary behind a JSONL seam (no rewrite); PyO3 deferred indefinitely because the certificate must serialize to JSON anyway for Lean; a cdylib+ctypes seam is the escalation if quench-in-loop is ever needed. Numba rejected: equal speed to Rust but pins numpy<2.5 and has opaque typing errors, the worst failure mode unattended. Recorded in the plan spec under 'Stack and boundaries'. Remaining open: whether sqpack-core eventually absorbs sqsearch's geometry, which Phase 5 decides.
