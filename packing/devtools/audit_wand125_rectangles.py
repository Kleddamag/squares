"""Audit wand125's rectangle-density certificates and replay the reviewed checker.

wand125/square-packing-bounds publishes certificates in Tokoharu's rectangle-density
format, checked by Tokoharu's unchanged ``verify.cpp``. This tool binds them to the
same first-party exact preflight as ``audit_tokoharu_density``: every interval in the
checker input encloses the exact rational datum, the axis-event partition is complete,
the orbit normalization preserves mass, and the total mass is strictly below ``n``.

The packet retains the exact candidates, not the tens of megabytes of derived interval
input. Each input is regenerated here from the candidate and must hash to the SHA-256
the upstream accepting run recorded, so the bytes replayed are the bytes published. The
checker source is the byte-identical copy already retained with Tokoharu's packet.

Each candidate is stored as deterministic gzip (``certified_candidate.json.gz``, listed in
the packet README's Compressed Files table). Every retained read here goes through
`devtools.retained_data.read_retained_bytes`, so the digests checked are those of the
upstream bytes, and a tree restored with ``gunzip -k`` reads the same.

Each retained pin of the source is one `Packet`: a directory under ``resources/web/``,
the revision, and the standing (highest) certificate for each count at that revision.
A packet with a ``base`` retains only the files that are new at its pin. A file an
earlier packet already retains byte for byte is read from there, through the base and
that packet's own base in turn, and the provenance check requires the digest this pin's
tree manifest records for it. ``--packet`` chooses the packet by its date; the default is
the first, so the commands its records give still mean what they said.

Global rotated coverage is still decided by the external C++ checker, so a replay is
V4/C3 machine evidence, exactly as for Tokoharu's own certificates.

Replays take hours each, so they run in batches, often on other machines, each into its
own ``--out``. ``--merge DIR...`` folds such receipts into one (normally the packet's
``receipts/replay``). Every case must be a passed replay of all 201 directions of this
packet's standing certificate: its exact preflight equal to the packet's own preflight
receipt, its input and checker digests the published ones, and the files beside it
present and consistent with it in full (the summary file equal to the receipt's summary,
the runner's output ending with it, the per-angle rows covering every direction with the
summary's totals). A receipt failing any of that, or not of the packet's revision, or
recording a failed run, is refused whole, and so is a case two receipts replayed with
different results; a refusal writes nothing. A run interrupted between cases records no
status, and the cases it lists, each complete, are taken. Agreeing duplicates (the same
results, other timings) keep the case already held. The merged receipt lists cases by
count, each with the host it ran on, and is the same bytes whatever the order of its
inputs and however often it is rerun. ``--check`` checks the receipt in ``--out`` the
same way and writes nothing; with ``--merge`` it is a dry run.

``--control`` is stage 4 of ``campaign/result-import.md`` for this checker: it runs one
standing certificate (``--n``) and two mutations of it on one net direction, by default
the one with the least lower bound in the upstream run's per-angle rows, and writes
``--out/NAME.json``. Each mutation leaves an exact witness centre covered below 1 at
that angle; the original must be accepted with the upstream row's results and both
mutations refused (`control`).
