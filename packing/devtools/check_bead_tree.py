"""Check the bead tree for the shapes that made D-025 unreadable, and who owns each deferral.

The beads are the work list. They live outside this directory -- on the `tbd-sync`
branch, not in the working tree -- so nothing in the gate could see them, and the one
time the tree went inconsistent it was found by a person reading `tbd list --spec` and
noticing two epics with the same title.

Two invariants are cheap and catch that whole class:

1. **No open bead sits under a closed parent.** A closed epic is a statement that its
   line of work is over; an open child under it is work nobody will list. This is
   exactly what D-025's first fix left behind -- it re-parented seven of eight children
   and reported "seven".
2. **No two open beads under one parent share a title.** Merging two trees that both
   modelled the same phase is how the duplicate arose; the duplicate is invisible in any
   view that shows one epic at a time.

A third invariant joins the tree to the records:

3. **Every deferral a record declares names a bead that is still open.** A deferral is
   work the record knows it has not done: a Kingbird count pending intake, a
   beyond-horizon claim held as a deferred conflict, a watched repository read past its
   newest packet, an issue still open, a result or ask queued on one. Each names its
   owning bead (`deferrals`), and a bead is still open while its state is one
   `devtools.bead_state.LIVE` holds: `closed` and `deferred` are not. The three counts
   pending intake from 2026-09-30 named none, nothing listed them, and the record called
   the older sides best known for five days; a bead closed under a live deferral is the
   same orphan by another route.

   The third reads the bead store, which changes with no tracked change at all, so in
   the gate it fails only a change to a record that declares deferrals: the gate passes
   `--warn-dead-deferrals` otherwise, and a dead deferral is printed as a warning. A
   continuous-integration checkout fetches `origin/tbd-sync`, so closing a bead a record
   names would otherwise turn every pull request and `main` red on a change that touched
   nothing. Closing such a bead therefore takes a record edit in the same change, and
   the next change to the record fails until it has one. Run directly, with no flag, the
   check fails a dead deferral wherever it is, as `devtools.intake_sweep` lists it.

None needs the `tbd` binary. The beads are Markdown-with-frontmatter files, and this
reads them straight out of git, preferring the local sync worktree so it works offline.

One more shape is reported and never failed on, because the agenda layer and the bead
tree are edited by different hands at different times and the gap between them is a
fact to read, not a violation to block a push on. An in-progress bead named only by
terminal agenda cells (`complete` or `stopped`) is work the agenda has finished with and
the tree still calls live; an in-progress bead named by no cell at all is work tracked
outside the agenda layer. Both lists are printed with their bead ids. Cells name beads
through the agenda's `bead` field, a `think-` alias that the store's `mappings/ids.yml`
resolves to the bead's id.

Run with `--json` for machine-readable output, and `--warn-dead-deferrals` to report a
dead deferral without failing on it. Exits 0 when clean, 1 on a violation, and 0 with a
loud skip when no bead store can be found -- a checkout without the `tbd-sync` branch is
a normal state, not a failure.
