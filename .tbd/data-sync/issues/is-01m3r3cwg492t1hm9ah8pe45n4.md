Spec: Published Media. Pin release tag, asset name, bytes and SHA-256 (the receipts' video_sha256) in sqpack/release.py; publish downloads both films into site/films/, fails on any mismatch (OR-16 trust boundary), caches by hash; pull requests never fetch. The explainer's <video> source moves to the same-origin copy.

## Notes

Reviewed design: publish runs for pull requests (only its upload is gated), so the fetch, verify and cache steps carry the upload's main-only condition. Pull requests never download the films.
