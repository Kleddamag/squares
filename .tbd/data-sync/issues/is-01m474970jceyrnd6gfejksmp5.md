evand/square-packing 13ee36e (s12/search/exact/batch/certs) certifies 321 of the 324 register records exactly. Issue #375 asks only for the 48 that improve the register (T-099, think-t6ok); the author offers the rest as an independent exact replay of existing upper bounds and asks for nothing. But at all 78 counts where the record's verified upper bound now trails its reported side (after T-099), the source holds a certificate 1e-20 to 1e-14 above the printed side: rounded up at the printed precision it would carry the verified lane to the report, off the integer grid at most of them (by up to 0.464 at n = 101, 122, 145, 170, 197, 226, 257, 290, 291), including 16 counts n <= 100 (28, 29, 37, 39, 41, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 69, 70, 71, 83, 87, 88). The packet evand-square-packing-2026-10-05 pins those certificates by digest (only the 48 are retained) and receipts/first-party-check.json and source-replay.json already decide all 320 (n = 17 held, think-x4v4). An import would retain the 78 (about 1.5 MB), register them (one upper-bound entry or an evidence update per the runbook's table), and move the verified lanes through a layer like devtools.apply_exact_optima. Owner decision: whether the record acts on certificates the author did not ask to register.
