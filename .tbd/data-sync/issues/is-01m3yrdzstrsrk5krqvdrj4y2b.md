Owner requirement: every confirmation states whether it re-ran the producer's own verification code or an independent implementation, and the records list each verifier by name as external or first-party. Deliverables: packing/frontier/verifiers.yaml registry (id, program, author, provenance external|first-party, language, method, digests, retained source); required evidence fields verifiers: [ids] and verifier_relation: producer-code|independent-implementation|shared-components (with independence_record / shared_components); check_results attribute beside the rung and rendered legend; a rendered verifier view; prose rule for the word 'confirmed'; re-runnable backfill tool packing/devtools/backfill_verifier_relation.py over all confirming evidence. Ships in the stacked PR on top of #298. After merging the import lanes, re-run the backfill on the merged evidence.yaml and require both fields on new entries.
