"""A site version bump is one command: it names the edition, redraws, checks, and stops.

The bump is when the large generated assets are rebuilt (the owner, 2026-10-01). What is
pinned here is the one edit the command makes by hand -- a new edition at the front of
`release.py`'s site history, written as the formatter leaves one, with no paper's own
history or version moved -- its refusals, that it changes nothing until the tree is clean
and the pin is current, and that what it leaves to the owner ends at the deployment
check, with no tag and no GitHub release. The redraw and the checks it then runs are
other modules' commands, with tests of their own.
