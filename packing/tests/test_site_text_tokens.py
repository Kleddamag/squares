"""The site's pages resolve the explainer's text tokens and faces, in a browser.

`paper-type.css` is the one source of the type base, the reading measure, the h2 scale
and the pinned faces; `test_overview` holds every page to inlining it. This opens a
rendered long report (the tutorial, with a contents rail) and a short one (the
readme) in Chromium and pins what those tokens resolve to, which is what the explainer
resolves (`templates/paper-design.md`, Text). It also injects the host font hook an
embedding viewer might set, and requires the page to keep its own faces.

Skipped where no Chromium can be launched; `SQPACK_CHROMIUM` names one the environment
supplies, as the other browser tools read it.
