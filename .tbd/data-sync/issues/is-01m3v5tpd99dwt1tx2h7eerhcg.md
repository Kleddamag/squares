Owner, 2026-10-01: land this as soon as possible, in an organized order, without time spent on conflicts. (1) jlevy/squares#255 is ready at 158820d9d: hosted CI 27 pass, mergeable, current with main 306ae9fab. The session permission check refused the merge (merge without review); the owner merges it (PR page, or gh api -X PUT repos/jlevy/squares/pulls/255/merge -f merge_method=merge; it is the base of a stack, so the ordinary merge call is refused). (2) After it merges: watch the Pages deploy, run check_published_site against the live site, record the overview and overview-unchanged job budgets from that run. (3) Point #262 at main once it carries the final website base and its gates pass; the owner merges. (4) #254 then takes one merge of main, one tool re-run and one gate run. (5) Follow-up PRs after that: claude/site-polish-2 (results table, intro), claude/prose-without-ceremony, the result-kind classification.

## Notes

2026-10-01 07:58 UTC: the owner merged the stack; jlevy/squares#255 and #262 landed together on main as f9a3409f0. Pages run 36833533118 and post-merge validation 36833532960 are running. Remaining: verify the live site; jlevy/squares#254 (math, now based on main) takes one merge of main; follow-up PRs claude/site-polish-2 and claude/prose-without-ceremony.
