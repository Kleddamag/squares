"""Reader-facing prose credits a result and links its source; it carries no audit mechanics.

The owner, on 2026-10-01, of a register claim that read "certified at commit c8b36419
on 26 September 2026 by the author's clock": "The point is not certifying timezones or
commits, it is proper credit and having a link to the appropriate sources. Hashes can
be recorded at the point of ingestion but should not appear in text." Of the sentence
that closed twenty-four claims, "An externally produced, previously published result, not
peer reviewed; no new first-party mathematics is claimed": "this is externally produced
if it says that ... it should just be a clear citation." And of the claims themselves:
"long blocks like this should be broken into paragraphs."

So a sentence a reader meets says who established what, on which plain date, with a link
to the source. A commit id, a digest, a clock or timezone qualifier, a packet's byte
count, and a disclaimer the credit line already makes are audit mechanics. Their home is
a field written at ingestion: an evidence entry, a source packet's README, acquisition
record and receipts, a bibliography note, a case record's `resources[].url` and
`priority_notes[].published`.

This module holds three things to that.

- **Register prose**: `headline`, `claim`, `composition`, `notes`, `next_rung` and
  `significance.rationale` of every entry in `frontier/results.yaml`, which
  `RESULTS.md`, the synopsis and the site print word for word.
- **Reader documents**: the root reader documents, the frontier README and status table,
  the site's article templates, and each case record's body and the front-matter fields
  the site's case pages print: every `note`, the rigidity `scope`, and the `detail` of a
  conflict or blocker and the `claim` of a priority note.
- **Paragraphs**: a paragraph of a register prose field that runs past
  `PARAGRAPH_CHARS` in more than one sentence is a finding. A blank line in the field
  divides paragraphs, and the renderers keep it (`devtools.register_prose`).

What it does not read, because each is a structured or historical home: evidence
entries, the bibliography, source packets and receipts under `resources/`, the rest of
a case record's front matter, session, agenda and campaign records, dated reviews, the
defect log, development documentation (where a commit tells a developer where a rule
came from), and the synopsis's working record: its status, contracts, handoffs,
sessions, experiments and defects. A link target is never prose, so a pinned revision
inside a URL is where a reader should find it.

`prose-ceremony.yaml` beside this module lists the sentences that keep a flagged word
for a stated reason. An entry that no longer matches anything fails the check, so the
list cannot outlive what it excuses.

`--retained` answers the question an editor has before deleting a hash from a sentence:
where else the record keeps it. It searches the structured homes above for each
hexadecimal run given, or for every one the inventory finds.
