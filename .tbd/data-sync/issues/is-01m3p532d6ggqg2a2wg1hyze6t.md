## Notes

Reviewed design: thumbnails are generated from the rendering SVGs with ids, titles and descriptions stripped, served as separate lazy <img> files (the SVGs total 52 MB and share ids with the explainer); records validated through softschema since load_cases does not; a lower bound's relation comes from the register entry citing its evidence.
