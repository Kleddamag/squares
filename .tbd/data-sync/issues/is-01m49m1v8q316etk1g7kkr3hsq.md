W6. Register H-NNN with frozen accept rule (relation verified at 2x the digits used to find it, irreducible, root isolates S_exact). Instrument wraps retained exactsolve.py (read before run) on Daniel's KKT points for the 54 numeric-only counts at rising precision; records identifications as contact-system with evidence, and negatives with degree/height/digit scope. Excludes n=29 (owned by think-je8y/obgk/gucc) and the 7 counts without a KKT point (105,130,292; bound-only 177,211,263,272).
