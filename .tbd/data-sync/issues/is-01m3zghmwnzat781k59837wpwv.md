Owner, 2026-10-02: 'make the default values like "all" gray if they are selected as they dont show any filtering active. if they are active the value shoul be black. the tallies (e.g. "324 cases") should be black as that is more important and significant'. A control showing its no-filter value (All, any, an empty field) is set in the support gray; a control that filters is set in the text colour, live as the reader changes it (table.js). The count at the bar's end ("324 cases", "7 of 65 results") is the text colour. Tests and paper-design.md follow.
