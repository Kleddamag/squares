From the coherence audit, 2026-10-01 (think-ldrb): pages.yml checks out without packing/resources/*/ and packing/campaign/*/, and the renderers asked the disk whether a cited path exists, so the live overview and Results page lacked 20 link targets each, the case records 19, and result overviews their certificate, proof and source-packet rows (T-060 lacked final-composition.json and PROOF.md). check_published_site passed 783 of 783 and could not see it. Fixed in bb82ba141 (links come from the git tree, not the disk), on claude/site-polish-4. Allocate a D-number in packing/defects.yaml with the cause and the missing check; add to check_published_site a check that a result overview carries its record links (after the next deploy, the live result/t-060.html must link final-composition.json).
