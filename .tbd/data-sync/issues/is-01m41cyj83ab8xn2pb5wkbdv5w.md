Found by the records lane 2026-10-03: receipts/n101/merged.json (all 201 directions, 7.69 CPU-h) and control.json (CONTROLS_REFUSED) were committed on 2 Oct (think-m7cm) but no evidence entry cites them; T-073 prose still says only index 150 replayed; n101-105 hold old verified bounds. Fix: E-n101-wand125-linear-1028-source-replay; new replayed entry V3/C3 for n101-105 (precedent T-045/T-070/T-074); T-073 next_rung narrows to n83; counts move. Own commit right after the restack push, before the stack merges.
