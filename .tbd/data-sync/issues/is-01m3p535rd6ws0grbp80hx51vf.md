## Notes

Reopened: Done only on claude/overview-page-impl, which was never pushed; the owner asked on 2026-09-30 that it be treated as lost. The decision is carried in the revised spec (plan-2026-09-29-github-pages-overview.md) and the work is to be redone.

Correction (2026-09-30 audit): the "treated as lost" reopen note above is wrong. claude/overview-page-impl was recovered, continued to a371c2f5f and is the branch of the overview PR. Group 1 was migrated on it in 5bff221b2 (README, TUTORIAL, SYNOPSIS, conventions, epistemics) without branch B's GitHub placement rules. Measured on GitHub 2026-09-30 at a371c2f5f (blob views, inline math elements vs literal dollars outside math): README 14 math spans, 0 literal; epistemics.md 3, 0; conventions.md 25, 1; TUTORIAL.md 461, 19 (for example side-B and /45-degree spans); SYNOPSIS.md not measured. The website PR converts those spans back to code so it lands clean; the rules themselves (B: c6798905c, b3c245275, cd36d3ddd, 9db587456) and the re-check of group 1 move to the separate math PR on claude/math-everywhere-phase3.
