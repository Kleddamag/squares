"""Source-bound figures for Paper II, the review of Kleddamag's s(11) > 31/8 (T-037).

Twelve static SVGs, II.1 to II.12 in reading order (plan
`plan-2026-10-05-n11-explainer-series.md` §6.2), and the facts their captions state.
Nothing here is another verifier: every drawing reads retained, hash-pinned data, checks
what it shows against it in exact arithmetic, and only then rounds to pixels.

The certificate is read with `sqpack.fractional.parent_core.load_kleddamag_parent_core`
and never through the archived `exact_mixed.py`, which imports numba and is not an
execution cache. The raw JSON is read beside it only for the orbit structure the loader
flattens, and the two readings are checked to agree charge for charge.

Inputs, each pinned by its SHA-256 and listed in `FIGURE_INPUTS` for the renderer's
`RENDER_INPUTS`:

- Kleddamag's `global-certificate.json` (T-037) and its portable Python replay
  `evidence/portable/python.json`, in the archived release;
- T-026's retained certificate on the 1,440-step net;
- T-059's replay journal (all 12,028 exact row minima with replayed exact witnesses),
  pinned by its inflated bytes as its summary pins it;
- this repository's native row journal (session 153);
- the register, of which only the ladder's rung records are pinned
  (`paper_figures.LADDER_DIGEST`).

A changed input is refused before anything is drawn. Every caption number comes from
`caption_facts()`; a caption names a fact and never types it.

II.3, the roadmap, is the one schematic; its numbers are facts like any other. II.4 and
II.6 place illustrative cores by hand: the centres below are display choices, and every
capture, disjointness and legality claim made of them is checked exactly at render.
