**A4 (Low): reporting and private APIs.**
- Line 647: a root that exits 0 reports `success` even when live descendants are killed at cleanup. Only `active_processes_before_cleanup` records it.
- `process_handle` (line 43) reads CPython's private `Popen._handle`.
- Resume uses the undocumented `NtResumeProcess`.
- All acceptable, but say so in the docs.

Authorized maintenance only. Disposition requires evidence and exact-head CI; no research follow-up reserved.
