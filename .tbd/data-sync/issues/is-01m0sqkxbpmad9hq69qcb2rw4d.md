close_reason: "Done: H-010 on main says a failure to find an escape 'is never a known-answer result or a certificate'. exp-016 decided on a strict algebraic escape with ten mutation controls."

Testing/measurement-validity correction. Failure of a continuous search to find an escaping box is not a known-answer test and cannot certify Figure 14 or any implication. Acceptance: living plans and reviews distinguish positive falsifier witnesses from proof certificates; H-010 never accepts on search saturation; retained outcome requires independently replayed finite/exact or interval certificates; controls mutate each proof node and demonstrate refusal.

## Notes

2026-08-24: living docs now treat only positive escape witnesses as falsifier controls; a historical review has a dated erratum. Keep open until exp-016's proof-node certificate mutations land.
