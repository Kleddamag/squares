T-007 registers Nagamochi 2005, Theorem 2 (V3/C1; the 2026-08-30 read left four items unverified). #295 (wand125) and PR #305's review (session-168) find Lemma 1 false for every a > 3, b > 2 (Karakuş's family, exact; chelokot's Lean counterexample, a square of side 1.0001 in the 4 x 4 container scoring 0.977543 < 1), so the published proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are incomplete. Nobody has shown the bound false.

How to finish:
1. The owner decides on PR #305's review (think-bmze answers #295 meanwhile).
2. Record the defect: a mapped review document listed in T-007's `reviews` with verdict defect-open, or `external_review.state: defect-found` on E-nagamochi-lower. Either makes T-007 `incomplete` (`python -m devtools.result_status --list`); run `uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.check_results`.
3. Re-derive every value T-007 supplies (46 operative verified-field values, 63 cited by #295) from what is proved: replayed certificates already above it, chelokot's kernel-checked s(n^2 - 2) = n and Karakuş's s(k^2 - 1) = k and 1/2 + sqrt(N - floor(sqrt N) + 1/4), each imported as its own entry first (result-import.md). `packing-validate --only "the borrowed lower bounds re-derive"` holds the case records to the closed form (devtools.check_nagamochi_bounds).
Expected CPU: none beyond the gate; the work is a review decision and record edits.
What refutes: a counterexample to the bound itself (no one has one). The Lemma 1 defect makes the result incomplete, not refuted.
What moves the rung: C3 needs a machine check of a corrected capacity argument for Theorem 1 (think-8y1g's lambda = 1 spike is one input). Without it T-007 stays C1, recorded incomplete, and the case records cite the replacements.
