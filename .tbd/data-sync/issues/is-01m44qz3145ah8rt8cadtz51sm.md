https://github.com/jlevy/squares/issues/281#issuecomment-5981480063: a data point for wand125 (cover LP at 4.823 converges to ~18.84 < 19). No result to register; advance read_through, note it in the #281 entry.

## Notes

2026-10-05 (tbd-moderate lane, commit 696167be9): read evand's #281 comment of 2026-10-04T15:16:46Z (issuecomment-5981480063): a data point offered to wand125 for s(19). Pure closed covers at container side 4.823, just above Hamalainen's s(18) packing (7+sqrt7)/2 = 4.82288: exact fractional-packing ceiling 18.4703, float cover LP ~18.84 < 19 (~0.8% room), so a certificate of s(19) > (7+sqrt7)/2 (hence s(18) < s(19)) looks within reach; wand125's 1927/400 is ~0.11% short. Source: evand/square-packing s12/search/CEILINGS_17_20.md section 6. No result to register. result-requests.yaml #281: read_through 2026-10-04T15:16:46Z, summary extended, bead added. No reply due (check_requests --report).
