Executed bounded diagnostic after Astra-max readiness review; local criterion met, complete external proof still open. Original predeclared contract: bind the retained 1000-node receipt, candidate and source/settings; reconstruct and verify its complete pending census. Refine all 67 depth-20 leaves twice with the existing longest-side split and unchanged exact common-core bound, four children each (268 child bounds). One 30-second cooperative cap. Success requires all 67 processed, no child below its parent bound, and at least one formerly unresolved parent closed by all four children reaching threshold 1. Incomplete is PARTIAL_DIAGNOSTIC; complete zero closures is a negative depth+2 result. Never promote proof or automatically expand the run. First implement reusable tool and the exact local analytic control described in the plan; test source identity, malformed census, timeout and missing-child refusals.

## Notes

The selected diagnostic completed after Astra-max readiness: all 67 parents and 268 children, 15 parent closures, 7.713767125 seconds including replay. DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY; 52 parents and 11 original queued boxes still preclude complete-angle coverage. Astra checked receipt partitions, monotonicity, closure flags and five source/input hashes, without recomputing clipping bounds. Ten focused tests pass; publication gate pending.

Final-source formatting-only reproduction matches every exact decoded result of the original reviewed receipt; only tool source hash and elapsed time changed. Final runtime8.994228833005764seconds; tool SHA808be05dfd7c968149379fcdb692aa3580725ff9a8a8ae67b4e8025ff111eac2. Native source, original receipt and AST-equivalence checkpoint remain in Git. Final-source push passed2,289tests before upstream merge; merged-head certification pending think-niqx.
