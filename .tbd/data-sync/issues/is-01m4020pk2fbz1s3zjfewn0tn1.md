Owner, 2026-10-03: 'the figures on the n=11 optimal proof explainer page are very wide on mobile widths' (papers/n11-optimality-review.html). Measure each figure's width at 390 and 320, find what sets it (an intrinsic SVG width, a min-width, a wide table or a fixed-size canvas), and make every figure fit the column or scroll inside its own box; shots at 390 and 1280, a geometry test.
