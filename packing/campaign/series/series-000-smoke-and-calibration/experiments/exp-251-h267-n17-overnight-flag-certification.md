  title: The arity-7 standing flags with the most census weight, run through the kernel under SW9's adaptive-row
    recipe at cap 1169/250, each closure admitted on the standing verifier's full pass

      least 5e-3, in projected-gain order (packing/campaign/explorations/X048-session-182-overnight/kernel-targets.txt),
      on the unique-state 24-cell cover at U = 1169/250.

    decision: in-progress
    primary_criterion: The certified residue is at most 10^4 orbits with every certificate independently
      checked; rejected if it exceeds 10^4 at arity seven or a certificate excludes the endpoint state.
    reason: Lane K's round is running; each closure is admitted as its verifier passes, and the verdict is
      written when the target list is exhausted.

# exp-251: Session 182 Lane K, the Heaviest Standing Flags

[H-267](../../../hypotheses/H-267-n17-isolated-sub-pattern-residue.md) asks whether
certified sub-patterns of arity at most seven leave at most $10^4$ orbits on the
unique-state cover. This round is lane K of the
[n17 overnight plan](../../../../../docs/project/specs/active/plan-2026-10-05-n17-overnight.md)
(BC-420): the nine arity-7 standing flags with the most census weight, run through the
kernel with the adaptive-row recipe that closed SW9, which they had never had.

The round is in progress.
Each closure is admitted as soon as the standing verifier passes it in full from the
clean run worktree, and this record gains a result per target until the list is
exhausted.

## Admitted So Far

| Target | Cells | Producer | Verifier | Census after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1, `s182-k1` | side-S0, side-N0, side-S1, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W, interior-S | closed in 305 s, 27 steps, 1,728 rows | full pass, 173 s | 102,124 states, 12,929 orbits |
| 2 | corner-SW, side-N0, side-W0, side-W1, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W | 24-round cap at 3,047 s, not closed | — | — |
| 3, `s182-k3` | corner-NW, side-N0, side-W2, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W, interior-S | closed in 195 s, 18 steps, 1,198 rows | full pass, 124 s | 89,456 states, 11,336 orbits (after lane A’s state 5683195 too) |
| 4, `s182-k4` | side-S0, side-S1, side-W2, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W, interior-S | closed in 597 s, 129 steps, 8,636 rows | full pass, 269 s | 83,148 states, 10,546 orbits |
| 5, `s182-k5` | side-S0, side-N0, side-W2, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W, interior-S | closed in 244 s, 25 steps, 1,600 rows | full pass, 82 s | 81,684 states, 10,360 orbits |
| 6, `s182-k6` | side-S0, side-W0, side-S1, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W, interior-S | closed in 214 s, 63 steps, 4,059 rows | full pass, 175 s | 79,872 states, 10,132 orbits |
| 7, `s182-k7` | side-N0, side-W1, side-W2, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W, interior-S | closed in 295 s, 19 steps, 1,216 rows | full pass, 163 s | 78,852 states, 10,003 orbits |
| 8, `s182-k8` | corner-SW, side-W0, side-W1, side-W2, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W | closed in 118 s, 18 steps, 1,152 rows | full pass, 69 s | 73,236 states, 9,291 orbits |
| 9, `s182-k9` | side-S0, side-W0, side-W1, side-W2, interior-SW, interior-NW, interior-W | closed in 1,132 s, 147 steps, 12,759 rows | full pass, 506 s | 72,296 states, 9,168 orbits |

At the margin of the certified count, in the order admitted: `s182-k1` 24,044 states and
3,024 orbits; `s182-k3` 12,660 states and 1,592 orbits; `s182-k4` 6,308 states and 790
orbits; `s182-k5` 1,464 states and 186 orbits; `s182-k6` 1,812 states and 228 orbits;
`s182-k7` 1,020 states and 129 orbits; `s182-k8` 5,616 states and 712 orbits; `s182-k9`
940 states and 123 orbits.
The first is exactly the census’s projected gain for that flag.

H-267’s threshold is read at arity at most seven, so the guard also counts the ledger
with only those entries: 80,260 states and 10,173 orbits after `s182-k9`, 173 orbits
above $10^4$. That count is
[census-arity7-after-k9.json](../../../explorations/X048-session-182-overnight/receipts/K/census-arity7-after-k9.json),
run on
[ledger-arity7-after-k9.yaml](../../../explorations/X048-session-182-overnight/receipts/K/ledger-arity7-after-k9.yaml),
the ledger of record filtered to entries of at most seven cells by the one-line command
in its header.
Its census, certified and entry blocks are identical to the count taken in
scratch at the 11:21 UTC admission, which this file replaces as the record.
The receipts are under
[receipts/K](../../../explorations/X048-session-182-overnight/receipts/K/), the
certificate’s small files under the X048 certificates folder, and its objects in the
[hosted-data manifest](../../../../hosted/n17-x048-session-168-certificates.yaml).
