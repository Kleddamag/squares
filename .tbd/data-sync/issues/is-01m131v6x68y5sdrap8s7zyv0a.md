  Done (bead review 2026-10-06, origin/main eb43ffe9a): BC-044 'exact solve and round trip' is state complete in agenda-005 on origin/main; integer-relation route built as packing/src/sqpack/promote/solve.py (81b92fc33) with the frozen margin rule, plus devtools/probe_elimination.py
resolution: null

Step 5 of the symbolic promotion route, unbuilt. No Groebner, resultant, PSLQ or LLL code exists in the tree; SymPy appears in three files and none is a general solver.

Two routes: elimination (Groebner basis in lex order, or resultants), or high-precision Newton followed by an integer relation algorithm that recognises the minimal polynomial.

Both produce guesses and both must be discharged. Integer relation finds a relation, not a proof: a degree-8 relation holding to 500 digits is overwhelming evidence and zero proof. Irreducibility over Q must be checked, the intended real root isolated from the others, and the result substituted back exactly. sqpack.field already does that half soundly, which is why step 6 is where this repository is strong.

Blocked on the contact system existing.
