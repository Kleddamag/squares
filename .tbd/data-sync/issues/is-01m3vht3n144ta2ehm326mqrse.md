From the table agent's report, 2026-10-01: with six columns the tables still scroll sideways at 1024 (18 px on the homepage, 63 px on the Results page) and at 768 (274 and 319 px), less than before. Result is held to 411 px by four unbreakable formulas and Credit has an 11.5rem floor. Options: let long formulas break or scroll inside their cell, switch to the card layout below about 1100 px, or accept the scroll. Also: at 1280 the columns use 1006 of 1104 px, so a result with a formula about 98 px wider than today's longest fails test_site_result_columns; and on a phone T-061's summary wraps so a line starts with a comma.

## Notes

Owner direction 2026-10-01 (see the new columns bead think-y6js): the Result column should be narrower and wrap cleanly; the n column wider. So: let the long formulas break; no card layout change asked.
