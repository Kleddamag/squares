"""Audit and replay wand125's linear certificates: points, segments and rectangles.

wand125/square-packing-bounds adds two certificates of a kind its superseded
``s(50) >= 147/20`` rung, ``mixed_n50_L735``, first used: a nonnegative measure of point
masses, uniform segments and uniform rectangles, each primitive standing for its eight
D4 images, with exact rational geometry and a total mass of ``n - 1/100000``, such that
every closed core of side ``9977/10000`` at each of 201 net half-angles of step
``83/40000`` has measure at least 1. They are

- ``certificates/mixed_n101_L1028`` (at ``af1db07``, unchanged at ``0c35d90``):
  ``s(101) >= 257/25`` from 333 point, 897 segment and 4 rectangle orbits; and
- ``certificates/mixed_n83_L935`` (at ``0c35d90``): ``s(83) >= 187/20`` from 86 point,
  222 segment and 774 rectangle orbits.

Both are decided by ``code/unified_linear_verify.cpp`` (SHA-256 ``0249726a...``) through
its Python driver, which re-exports each angle's input from the candidate and requires the
checker to return the stored record. The checker is byte for byte the one in the
``mixed_n50_L735`` bundle the 2026-09-28 packet pins. The 2026-10-02 linear packet retains
the seven files of ``code/`` that no other packet holds; the other six are the retained
``mixed_n50_L740/code/`` copies. `LINEAR` names each certificate with its statement.

``linear-audit`` recomputes from the packet's retained bytes, importing no source code,
every premise that is plain arithmetic: the pinned digests, the schema, the stated count,
side, core and orbit counts, each primitive inside the container and nondegenerate with a
nonnegative mass, the exact total ``n - 1/100000``, the D4 expansion and its invariance,
the candidate digest by the source's rule, the net's containment, a positive centre domain
at all 201 angles, the checker's and the code's identity, a replay record for each angle,
and the source audit's certificate and tarball digests. It decides no coverage.

``linear-fetch`` obtains the pinned tarball, refuses it unless its SHA-256 and size are the
pinned ones, unpacks it afresh, binds every file of the bundle to the packet, assembles
the shipped ``code/`` from the retained copies, repeats the driver's preconditions, and
binds every angle's input to the candidate by an independent enclosure check.
``linear-replay`` does that for a range of angles and then replays each with the shipped
``replay_angle`` and the checker the shipped ``compile_verifier`` builds, writing receipts
as each angle finishes; it is the mixed range driver
(`devtools.audit_wand125_point_and_mixed.replay_directions`), so ``linear-merge`` is
``mixed_merge`` and a certificate can be split across sessions. ``linear-plan`` splits the
angles by recorded node counts, ``linear-price`` estimates each replay from timed single
angles, and ``linear-control`` is stage 4 of ``campaign/result-import.md``: the original
and two mutations on one net direction, each mutation provably uncovered at an exact
witness centre, the original accepted and both refused.
