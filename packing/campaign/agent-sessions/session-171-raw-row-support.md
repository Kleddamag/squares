  title: Raw-piece row-support witnesses without dense graph expansion

  branch: guzhou/n17-residual-compatibility
  primary_bead: think-op6s
  status: stopped
  goal: Determine whether every live row in the frozen B raw-piece pair graph has a complete
    support witness, with fresh replay.
  workflow_phases:
  - workflow: pipeline-improvement
    focus: efficiency
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    objective: Build a lazy raw-piece row-support search and fresh witness verifier; avoid full
      graph expansion.

  checks:
  - Original gate declarations below are historical branch evidence. The rewritten
    review layer remains uncertified; no source target or mathematical replay was rerun.
  - Prior PR 333 head 526a6c3a3 current required CI all terminal SUCCESS; local supervisor v2 independently
    accepted.
  - D1:34 focused tests pass; Ruff and typecheck zero findings; endpoint 24 rows replayed.
  - Coordinator fresh B replay checks 49 selections/735 pairs; 55 rows supported, 41 unresolved; no
    exclusion.
  - 'D1 f0b94b047 hosted CI terminal: sole validation failure was completed-D1 delegation left
    active past deadline; corrected without changing any ceiling.'
  - D2 contemporaneous replan reserves six workflow phases (taskbook ceiling 8); original 90 minute
    endpoint and all target caps unchanged.
  - D2:44 focused tests, Ruff/types pass; endpoint 24 rows and exact endpoint replayed. Root fresh
    B replay 57 selections/855 pairs; 69 rows supported, 27 unresolved.
  - Actual 12:44:59 publication entry is a work checkpoint before the reserved 13:11:55 tail;
    original 90 min endpoint and 15 min reserve retained. Early terminal closeout does not invent
    tail clocks.

    Branch association is operator-declared; live-session/boundary limitations retained; later
    publication tail is outside this lower bound.

# Raw-piece row-support diagnostic

The phase contract was recorded before implementation.
Upstream capture and Flag2 remain owned by think-tmz6; this session owns only
think-op6s. A complete support witness is a finite graph choice, never a geometric
packing. Large inputs stay outside Git.
