Build an opt-in exact cover helper that enumerates only segment pairs with overlapping closed x-projections, preserving all vertex and line-crossing events including equal-endpoint tangency. Differential-check event sets and cover verdicts against the frozen all-pairs backend on analytic adversarial shapes and representative pinned 1383 source geometry. Measure matched row cost before connecting the backend to accepted replay; no source proof credit from a primitive benchmark.

## Notes

Astra approved indexed exact-cover source SHA 68580e324e56c555ea0587b6f396b208fb66563d1e10bd449b446c97b7667ccd. Six focused controls pass; Ruff/format/BasedPyright clean. Retained source-bound benchmark receipts/nonfield-manifest/indexed-cover-benchmark.json: accepted 2095 rows 0/22/31 exact full-cover and receipt parity; representative 1383 node0 step1 row2 full source-proposal event set 613/1738 edges matches all-pairs, 1.682 vs 8.085 CPU seconds (4.81x event construction), 26.24s bounded benchmark wall. This is diagnostic, not case credit or whole replay speed. Four retained spawn receipts show whole-node128.3MB pickle vs current-step23.8MB; 3-worker startup1.864s vs0.551s. Parent integrating opt-in backend and current-step worker payload; full 1383 replay remains unverified.
