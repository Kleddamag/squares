Review B finding B4 on jlevy/squares#347 (https://github.com/jlevy/squares/pull/347#pullrequestreview-5411026138), at head 9d2f05582. 4c060f233 adds E-n017-catalogue-polynomial-identity (packing/frontier/evidence.yaml:82) and V-n17-catalogue-polynomial, annotates T-065 (results.yaml:5771) and rewrites four passages of n-017.md; it is the data commit behind the DATA_REVISION re-pin. The reviewer found its evidential status consistent (derived-structure, verified, same-implementation, external review informally-verified; bound, rungs and open status unchanged). The body claims nothing about it and no reviewer of the PR has read it. Fix: list it under Results and Changes by Purpose, and have the register's usual reader check it before merge. The register work itself is think-yjgk (delivered in 4c060f233, closes when #347 merges).
