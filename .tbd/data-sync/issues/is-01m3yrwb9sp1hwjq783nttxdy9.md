Owner, 2026-10-02: 'let's move "verified" and "confirmed" to a status column, and check we have this status column accurate and use that as it is really more of a status than a "rung". "optimality" is the type of the result so it can stay out of status'. In both tables of results (the Overview's Recent Results and all-results.html), the status line now under the rung chips (status_marks: confirmed, verified, recorded, superseded and the rest) becomes a Status column of its own, after Rungs: Date, Result, n, Credit, Rungs, Status, ID. The kind chip (optimality, lower bound, ...) stays under the rungs. Check each row's status against its record (result_status), so the column says what the register says; the Status filter, sorting, the phone card, the row popover and the column-width tests follow. Tests and paper-design.md updated.

## Notes

2026-10-02: committed 03cf705ea (Status column; statuses checked against result_status: 56 confirmed, 4 reviewed, 3 recorded, 2 incomplete; T-003 rightly unmarked). Widths pinned in 1fb775810 (think-e4o3). PR jlevy/squares#310 opened 2026-10-02 (head 38346bf4a); close when it merges.
