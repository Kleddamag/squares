"""Decide Evan Daniel's exact square-packing certificates with this repository's geometry.

``evand/square-packing`` at ``13ee36e`` (5 October 2026) publishes, under
``s12/search/exact/batch/certs/``, one certificate ``n-N.cert`` of ``s(n) <= S'`` for 321
of the register's 324 counts: ``n`` unit squares, each a rational centre ``(x, y)`` and a
rational ``t = tan(theta/2)``, so that ``(c, s) = ((1 - t^2)/(1 + t^2), 2t/(1 + t^2))``
satisfies ``c^2 + s^2 = 1`` exactly, inside a box of rational side ``S'``. At 48 counts
``S'`` lies below the side the register reports, by 3e-13 to 5e-11; issue #375 asks for
those to be registered. The source checks each certificate with two exact checkers of its
own (``verify_cert.py`` and ``verify_cert2.py``).

No checker here read that form, so this module converts it exactly and decides it with
the two exact checkers this repository already runs in its ``exact verification`` step:

- the certificate becomes a rational ``center-basis`` Witness/v2, ``(x, y)`` and ``(c, s)``
  as fractions, which ``sqpack.witness.exact_verify`` materializes and decides over Q;
- the same squares as rational corners, computed here from ``(x, y, c, s)``, go to
  ``devtools.check_rational_witness_independent``, which shares no geometry or
  verification code with ``sqpack``.

The parse and the map from ``t`` to ``(c, s)`` are this module's own and are the common
mode of the two decisions; the corners built here go to the independent checker alone,
which checks their shape itself. The source's checkers are not imported by any code here:
``source-replay`` runs them as separate processes, and ``controls`` copies them, unchanged,
into a scratch tree to run the source's ``verify_all.sh``.

**What its author read.** The format as the source's README states it, and the source's
``verify_cert.py`` and ``verify_cert2.py``, read before this module was written to
confirm that the corners it builds from ``(x, y, t)`` are the squares those checkers
decide; nothing of theirs, nor of the source's solver, is imported or copied. The two
deciders predate this import: ``sqpack.witness`` is this repository's own, and
``devtools.check_rational_witness_independent`` was written to share no geometry or
verification code with it.

Subcommands, from ``packing/``:

``check [--certs DIR] [--n N ...] [--workers K] [--receipt PATH]``
    Parse, convert and decide every certificate, and write a receipt of each verdict,
    its exact side and its least clearances. Without ``--certs`` it reads the packet's
    retained certificates and writes ``receipts/first-party-check.json``; that receipt is
    what ``--check`` holds the retained certificates to.

``check --check``
    The retained certificates' digests and sides against the committed receipt, and
    each case record of an improving count against it. Fast and offline; the tests run
    it.

``source-replay --checkers DIR --certs DIR [--receipt PATH]``
    Run the source's own ``verify_cert.py`` and ``verify_cert2.py``, as retained, on
    each certificate with this project's interpreter, and record each exit status and
    verdict line.

``compare``
    Each improving certificate's side against the register's reported and verified
    upper bounds, and its pose against the register's known-best witness: the largest
    centre displacement and rotation difference over the squares, matched by nearest
    centre. Writes ``receipts/register-comparison.json``.

``controls``
    For each improving certificate, three altered copies: one square moved just past
    touching its tightest neighbour, the box shrunk past its least wall clearance by one
    unit of the side's denominator, and the box shrunk by that one unit alone, which is
    still a valid certificate when its clearance exceeds the unit. Every checker must
    refuse the first two. Writes ``receipts/negative-controls.json``.

The count ``n = 17`` is held by the owner for the n = 17 work on other branches
(think-x4v4): no subcommand reads, replays or records its certificate.
