# Plan: Transfer Recent Optimality Methods to n = 17 and Other Low Cases

**Date:** 2026-10-01

**Status:** Planning and source review in progress; overnight continuation scheduled

**Workflow:** W3 insight iteration → W10 selection and codification → bounded W6
execution, with W7 only for a missing instrument and W2 for high-risk or promoted
claims.

**Tracking:** `think-7x1u` (program), `think-nb6b` (this planning deliverable).

## Objective

Find a credible route to another low-n optimality theorem, with n = 17 first.
Use the recent n = 11 global optimality proof and other imported results to identify
which structural lemmas, certificate mechanisms, and verification tools transfer.
The next session starts with mathematical exploration; tooling work serves a selected
proof obligation.

## Branch and Evidence Baseline

Branch `codex/w3-post-optimality-transfer` starts at `751ef78a4` on
`codex/n11-explainer-doc-review`, the head of
[PR #261](https://github.com/jlevy/squares/pull/261). The research baseline also
includes merged main at `f9a3409f0f03298fbeeb0a03788cd016087626b9`, read without
importing unrelated website changes into this stack.
The October 1 checkpoint incorporates the updated parent at `c56d5264c`, which already
contains that main baseline.
The parent merge resolved the inherited publication conflicts without manual edits to
publication code.
Before execution, re-read current main and reconcile any further result
changes. Keep the PR based on its parent until that parent merges.

## Research Basis

[X-048](../../../../packing/campaign/explorations/X-048-n17-optimality-after-n11.md)
maps nine routes, their mathematical obligations and their first discriminators.
The initial selection is n17 first, n12 in parallel, and n20 as the first fallback.
n18 and n19 remain structural alternatives; n26 and n29 are reserve targets.
n11 and n21 supply accepted machine-checked controls and reusable arguments.

Three facts determine the opening work:

- n17 has a verified strict lower bound 4.66044 and a reported Bidwell packing at
  4.675530…, but the verified upper field is still 5. Exact candidate admission has its
  own proof obligations.
- The retained n17 witness has numerical evidence of sliding squares.
  Seek a side theorem for a family or backbone, not isolated coordinates.
- An elementary n17 centre grid already yields over eight billion raw occupancy masks.
  Price geometric pruning before building a complete enumeration.

The n12 additive obstruction reported by evand needs an independent check.
The October audit recovered side-4 and side-5 support files; side-3.99 support remains
missing. X-048 records the distinction.
Do not substitute an unverified obstruction for a proved impossibility theorem.

## Goal Hierarchy

1. **Scientific goal:** obtain a new global optimality theorem, or a decisive
   obstruction to a proposed route, prioritizing n17.
2. **Immediate mathematical goal:** select a credible global exclusion/capture route and
   a compatible endpoint theorem; investigate a direct endpoint measure in parallel.
3. **Supporting verification goal:** exact upper witnesses, complete closed-domain
   coverage, clear certificate interfaces and independent acceptance.
4. **Supporting efficiency goal:** cheap discriminators and measured throughput on the
   selected proof work.
   Native-code optimization is selected only by a measured bottleneck, not made a
   prerequisite for mathematical exploration.

This planning block changes no theorem, bound, rating, verifier or production default.
The owner has requested a new W3 entry.
The older synopsis handoff remains historical context; this plan does not rewrite
another session’s completion record or close its remaining verification beads.

## Next Session: Parallel Lanes and Checkpoints

Create the actual session record when execution begins, using the next available session
ID and real start/deadline fields.
Do not reserve a fictional started session now.
Use the existing campaign and schemas; no new experiment framework is needed.

| Checkpoint | Work in parallel | Deliverable and exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opening W3 | A: n17 endpoint/family; B: n17 occupancy/charge; C: low-n endpoint transfer | Each lane returns source-pinned assumptions, one strongest candidate, a falsifier, tool readiness and a cheapest useful test |
| W10 selection | Coordinator reconciles all lanes; Astra max checks the mathematical bridge; Sol checks executable contracts | Select one n17 discriminator and at most one secondary target, or retain explicit blockers if none is ready |
| W6 or narrow W7 | Run independent selected work concurrently; build only a named missing checker or producer seam | Fixed criterion and controls, frozen implementation before target measurement, durable output and all unresolved cases |
| W2 checkpoint | Independent mathematical review and implementation/evidence audit | Accept, refute, remain unresolved, or block; update claims only to the level the evidence supports |
| W5 checkpoint | Profile the measured bottleneck while other proof obligations proceed | A bounded improvement or rejection under unchanged correctness controls; return to the scientific lane |
| Integration | Coordinator updates the exploration, selected agenda entries, beads and PR | Every selected item has a disposition and next evidence; all completed evidence is committed and discoverable |

The opening W3 block is an actual research task, not a repeat of the intake survey.
Start from X-048 and challenge its strongest routes.
Do not restart broad literature ingestion unless a named missing source affects the next
decision.

### Lane A: Candidate Endpoint and Flexible Family

**Bead:** `think-s6ty`. **Owner roles:** Astra max mathematics; Sol implementation
assessment when needed.
**Write ownership:** a dedicated endpoint review or result directory selected at launch;
no shared frontier edits.

Inspect the Bidwell witness, coordinate precision, algebraic root and contacts.
Separate a relaxed feasible upper enclosure from an exact endpoint construction.
Identify free sliding parameters and test whether a backbone side inequality can be
proved uniformly over them.
Return the missing hypotheses and the smallest exact subsystem to check first.
Local side minimality alone does not establish global optimality.

### Lane B: Global Cover, Charge and Endpoint Alternatives

**Bead:** `think-70sf`. **Owner roles:** Sol tooling/geometry inventory, with Astra max
review of proposed lemmas.
**Write ownership:** a separate global-route note and prospective instrument contract.

Compare closed centre covers, R068 low-charge compatibility, direct endpoint measures
and subconfiguration cuts from settled cases.
Count or bound cases before expensive geometric exclusion.
Reuse H-248 / BC-387 for the capacity-one architecture fork; do not repeat its claim
under a new ID. Keep exact finite-program improvement separate from full continuous
verification.

### Lane C: Low-n Alternatives

**Bead:** `think-ayt3`. **Owner role:** Sol research and source comparison, with an
Astra max check for any selected new mathematical implication.
**Write ownership:** a low-n comparison note.

At n12, recover the reported fractional obstruction’s missing evidence and study
conditional occupancy rather than an unrestricted additive endpoint search.
At n20, identify the precise count or boundary condition lost from the n21 proof.
Use n18/19 only when a small endpoint subsystem or new global inequality makes them
competitive with those two routes.
No stronger reported lower bound enters the verified column without W2 acceptance.

### Coordinator: Select and Freeze

**Bead:** `think-eh7g`, blocked on the three opening lanes.
Reconcile the current active
[agenda-042](../../../../packing/campaign/agendas/agenda-042-overnight-n11-settlement-and-low-n-angles.md)
and its stale n11/n21 objectives.
At W10, either add current BC commitments there or explicitly disposition the old agenda
before creating a successor.
BCs, H-IDs and exp-IDs are allocated only when their artifacts are ready, not invented
as placeholders in this plan.

For each chosen experiment freeze:

- Target domain, rational cap or exact endpoint, source revisions and all assumptions
- One falsifiable criterion, including how failure differs from unresolved work
- Positive controls, adversarial refusals and the independent acceptance interface
- Input set, process/memory/node/output limits and timeout behavior
- Producer and checker commands, output location, resume policy and owner
- Mathematical payoff: a usable lemma, a complete case exclusion, a route obstruction,
  or a cost estimate that changes the next decision

The opening three agents can work concurrently within the available four slots,
including the coordinator.
After their reports arrive, reuse slots for implementation and adversarial review.
No two agents mutate the same registry, idea board, agenda or frontier record.
The coordinator owns those shared records and the PR.

## Validation and Efficiency

For this documentation-only plan, validate exploration schema, local links, document
map, generated synopsis and idea-board/ledger consistency.
Do not replay the n11 proof or run unrelated slow local tests to validate prose.
The normal hosted checks still apply to the PR.

For future proof work, first run a small known-valid case and a deliberately invalid
case through the exact acceptance path.
Record complete coverage, pending cases and skipped checks explicitly.
Use source checkers as comparison oracles while keeping a separately reviewed native
acceptance path for claims requiring independence.
Tools currently bound to n11 data require adaptation and review before n17 use.

Measure preparation, producer, checker and orchestration costs separately.
Record wall time, CPU, memory, case/node counts and output size for a fixed workload.
Parallelize independent cases and reviews; keep compilation caches and loaded input data
reusable when equivalence is preserved.
Run one representative end-to-end case before committing to a full census.

The first W5 checkpoint is after at most four execution blocks, and earlier if a
declared ceiling is missed or repeated setup dominates useful work.
Freeze the metric, workload, validity guards and stopping rule before timing a candidate
improvement. If compilation, orchestration or general CI is slow, improve that layer; do
not attribute it to rational arithmetic without a profile.
W5 runs beside independent mathematical work and cannot weaken the proof contract.

All temporary builds and caches use a verified writable external scratch directory with
explicit `TMPDIR`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and `UV_CACHE_DIR`. Unique research evidence lives
in the repository, not disposable scratch.

## Completion and Publication

The planning deliverable is complete when X-048, this run sheet, the idea-board entry
and linked beads are reviewed and published on the stacked PR. The future session is
complete at a coherent evidence checkpoint, with each selected route explicitly
accepted, refuted, unresolved, blocked or deferred with its reason.
It need not claim a new theorem to leave a useful result.

Keep the PR based on `codex/n11-explainer-doc-review` while #261 is open.
Once the parent merges, reconcile current main and retarget the child to main, checking
that its diff contains only this research planning work.
Run focused checks again after conflict resolution and keep the PR’s evidence and
disposition tables current.
Do not merge this child ahead of the required parent integration.

## Overnight Execution: October 1

The owner has authorized autonomous execution after the planning blocks, including
bounded research-loop experiments.
Thread heartbeat **Post-optimality overnight research**
(`post-optimality-overnight-research`) resumes this task every 30 minutes.
The fixed stop is **2026-10-01 08:00 America/Los_Angeles**, or 15:00 UTC; **07:30
Pacific** starts the protected finalization interval.
These are one night’s absolute limits, not a fresh budget on each wake.
The schedule permits a final wake after the deadline only to close existing work and
pause itself.

**Execution bead:** `think-kaqh`. The active run remains recoverable from the repository
if the heartbeat is delayed.
At actual launch, create the next valid session record with the real start, the fixed
stop above and phase-level guards.
If a matching active session already exists, resume it; never create a duplicate.
The next agent reads the current clock before starting any command.

### Incorporate the Evand Review Before Selecting Experiments

The owner also requested a current W1 source survey and independent W2 correctness
review of evand’s [proof index](https://evand.github.io/square-packing/proofs.html),
[source index](https://evand.github.io/square-packing/sources.html), and relevant linked
GitHub proof artifacts.
`think-a0fj` owns source/citation coverage; `think-yew8` owns mathematical review.
These run in parallel with the n17 planning lanes.
Read the [source audit](../../reviews/review-2026-10-01-evand-source-coverage.md) and
[mathematical review](../../reviews/review-2026-10-01-evand-mathematical-transfer.md)
before W10 selection; independently useful n17 work may proceed while a particular
external obligation remains blocked.
New external claims enter the plan as source assertions until their acceptance
requirements are met.
Missing claims receive result and evidence records, with significance and assurance
assessed separately; an infinite family’s finite projection onto the case corpus must
not obscure its full claimed scope.
Follow-up acceptance work is tracked by `think-4k80` (finite family premise and Lean
reduction), `think-e7xa` (s60 mixed cover), and `think-q5tt` (fractional dual guards and
replays).
The large family and width-three runs are selected explicitly, not started as a
side effect of source intake.

The source intake uses a separate current-main branch, `codex/evand-october-survey`,
tracked by `think-l1zd`, so its result IDs and assurance fields use the current rubric.
Its checkout is the attached `validation-parity` worktree; it is separate from this
research branch. Resume each branch in its own checkout.
Remaining source gaps have named owners in the queue: `think-hxrz` acquires the
independent wand125 s61 primary source; `think-e8qx` reconciles newer formalization and
checker evidence for older evand results; `think-kqi1` addresses universal-family schema
support. `think-2z60` independently reviews the auxiliary clique-threshold repair before
a proof uses it.

### Execution Limits and Recovery

- At most three delegates and two compute-heavy subprocesses run concurrently.
  Sol handles implementations and intake; Astra max handles hard mathematics and
  adversarial review. Keep all shared-record writes with the coordinator.
- Use slices of at most 30 minutes, with useful evidence retained by minute 20. A
  command’s supervised timeout cannot outlast its slice or finalization start.
  Record process identities and stop children at timeout; do not leave orphaned work.
- Before each target run, freeze its hypothesis, domain, criterion, input revision,
  node/output/memory caps and positive/negative controls.
  New observations can justify a new preregistered experiment, never a changed criterion
  on an existing one.
- Run at most three target rounds per hypothesis before review and explicit
  reprioritization. Three consecutive guard failures or crashes stop that instrument.
  Retain invalid and inconclusive outputs and their causes.
- Do not run the generic `packing-campaign run` queue.
  At planning time its only ready hypothesis was the unrelated H-017 n11 search; H-248
  was not instrument-ready.
  Inspect readiness afresh, then execute only the explicitly selected experiment.
- A missing instrument can receive a bounded W7 slice with controls.
  If no candidate can be admitted, preserve a blocker and continue an independent
  mathematical or source obligation; do not manufacture a research verdict.
- Use the existing external scratch policy.
  Do not install new dependencies or alter version pins unattended.
  Keep raw evidence and finished reports under version control.
- Regular commits, pushes to this research branch, bead sync and evidence comments on PR
  #265 are authorized.
  Force-pushes, PR merges, deployments and edits to another agent’s mutable branch are
  outside this overnight run.

At each wake, verify the branch and active processes before writing.
If the checkout has moved or contains another agent’s changes, preserve them and
re-establish a safe research checkout before continuing.
The inherited parent/main publication conflict was resolved by incorporating the updated
parent. `think-y7za` still owns retargeting after the parent merges and checking the
final diff; passing CI does not itself merge either PR.

### Morning Handoff

From 07:30, stop opening experiments and assemble existing evidence.
The report leads with what changed scientifically: accepted checks, refuted candidates,
unresolved domains and missing sources, each with scope and replay commands.
Include elapsed command, orchestration and review costs; distinguish numerical screens,
exact checks, source replays and independent confirmation.
List the next selected mathematical question and the blockers that would change it.
Update the session, ledger, beads and PR, commit and push the recoverable checkpoint,
then pause the heartbeat.
At or after 08:00, perform only this closeout, never additional target work.
