Review B finding B3 on jlevy/squares#350 (https://github.com/jlevy/squares/pull/350#pullrequestreview-5411026984), at head 9179aab7d. Missing: 'Where n = 17 stands', Results and Dispositions, Changes by Purpose, Documentation and Replanning, and the guideline footer. Validation covers only 290488836 and 09a52bc64 on #307's history; nothing covers the rebased head, where the native step now runs in measure-verifier. The closed #361 carried these sections for the identical diff (tree fbe696117). Fix: port them without #361's leftover PUSH350 placeholder, and add validation at the current head.
