"""Draw the picture a shared link to the site shows: the homepage's hero, as a card.

Every page of the site names one image in its link preview
(`render_overview.head_tags`): the homepage's hero, the best packing known of
`overview_sections.HERO_CASE` squares, at 1200 by 630, the size every consumer shows as
a large card without cropping it. This draws that image when the site is built. It is
the hero's own drawing, `render_frontier_page.packing_svg` at the hero's 1000 units, so
its squares, its colours and its line weights are the page's, in the page's ink on the
page's background as the light theme has them (`rung_scale.page_colours`, read from
kpress's tokens). Under it is the project's name as the bar sets the site's: the bar's
sans in capitals, at the bar's weight and letter spacing.

The name is drawn as outlines, from the face kpress ships, and not as text. A rasteriser
sets text in whatever font the machine has under that name, which on a runner is none of
the site's; outlines are the same on every machine, and the card needs no font installed.
Glyphs are placed by their advances with the bar's letter spacing and no kerning, which
capitals this widely spaced do not miss.

The card is built and not checked in, as the site's pages are: a raster is drawn by the
machine's Cairo, so its bytes are that machine's, and a committed copy would be a second
thing to keep in step with the drawing. `preview_site` writes it into the site it
builds, and the Pages workflow's `overview` job writes it beside the pages, into the
published directory and into the twin it compares that with, so a card that does not
reproduce itself fails there. A write is refused over `BYTE_CEILING`.

Usage, from `packing/`:
    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.social_card
    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.social_card --output-dir DIR
    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.social_card --check
    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.social_card --plain --svg

`--check` compares the card in the directory with a fresh drawing and writes nothing.
`--plain` leaves the name out, and `--svg` writes the drawing itself beside the PNG, for
looking at; neither is what the site serves. On macOS the rasteriser needs Homebrew's
Cairo: `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib` (development.md, Supported
Environment).
