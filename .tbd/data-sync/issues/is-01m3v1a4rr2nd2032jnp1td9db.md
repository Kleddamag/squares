On 2026-09-30 and 10-01 the pull-request timing rules failed four hosted runs with no failing test: jlevy/squares#255 shard C at 172 s and 140 s twice against a recorded 88.59 s (1.5x fails), on a runner fleet about 2x slow for every branch that evening; jlevy/squares#255 and #262 checks tier at 59.4 s and 62.3 s against a recorded 114.34 s ('stale in the flattering direction', 0.52x and 0.54x), on fast runners. The same code read 59 to 133 s for the checks tier and 84 to 172 s for shard C across the day. The pull-request wall is already advisory under think-g4n9 for 1.6 to 1.8x runner variance; the per-tier drift rules are still enforced and inherit the same variance in both directions. Owner, 2026-10-01: delegate to Fable to fix the failed CI. Fix the rule so a run is judged on its code, with the ratchet's purpose kept (a real slowdown is still caught), using today's hosted measurements as the test set; land it on the website PR's integration line.
