14 comments on #282 (2026-10-04T07:04Z..19:04Z), commits 683264c..797bdf6 of wand125/square-packing-bounds. Stages 1-3: claim map against the record, packet at the last commit, register T-090 at V0, read_through on #282. Replay (stage 4) priced and queued, not run: same verifier as mixed_n84_L940, ~7 CPU-h per certificate.

## Notes

2026-10-05 re-scope (coordinator): this bead's import is now T-091 = the 12 certificates at 797bdf6 (n = 53, 54, 58, 70, 71, 73, 76, 87, 88, 90, 91, 94); n69 L862 and n86 L9503 moved to T-090 (the 16 at 8aa6a10, think-e6ss). Branch claude/ecstatic-pascal-pothtx-wand125, commits 861a9f258 (packet + audit rows + tests), 696167be9 (first registration), 805313037 (re-pin), 905621e8b (T-090/T-091 split), 76e73f5ab (think-aigs updates), d5271d182 (re-pin). Not pushed.

Pin: 797bdf6e10eba5f9dccca9da06f8352e81ba9dde (head, 2026-10-04T19:03:58Z, nothing later). Packet packing/resources/web/wand125-mixed-bounds-evening-2026-10-04, key [wand125 mixed bounds evening 2026-10-04]; acquire_source --check PACKET_MATCHES_ITS_CONTRACT; mixed-audit all 12 pass; mixed-fetch all 12 BUNDLE_READY.

Claim map for T-091 (prior reported value, holder): n53 3051/400 > 3043/400 rect (T-068/T-074); n54 1537/200 > 3069/400 rect (T-068/T-074); n58 1587/200 > 1581/200 (T-082); n70 3463/400 > 3459/400 (T-082); n71 8721/1000 > 1741/200 (T-082); n73 8813/1000 > 8809/1000 (T-082); n76 1793/200 > 224/25 (T-082); n87 479/50 > 191/20 (T-082); n88 481/50 > 769/80 (T-090; T-082 48/5 before); n90 973/100 > 389/40 (T-082); n91 781/80 > 39/4 (T-082); n94 199/20 > 497/50 (T-090; T-082 248/25 before). Margins 0.004-0.03; none carries by monotonicity.

T-091: V0/C0, S3 draft, published 2026-10-04. #282 result oct4-mixed-12 -> T-091. Replay (think-wrdq): 130.8 CPU-h planned (116.9 x 1.119; 137.7 by the source's oblique seconds), mixed-shard wand125-mixed-bounds-evening-2026-10-04 --runners 6 (~21-22 CPU-h, ~5.5 wall-h per runner at 4 workers). Blind review pending: brief at the coordinator.

Validation: records tier fails only on id contiguity (T-088/T-089 on the Kingbird lane); renumbered to T-088/T-089 in a scratch worktree, check_results and 93 register tests pass. See the final report for the push tier.

2026-10-05 03:30Z validation at 2bcc69791: records tier fails only id contiguity; push tier: lint, types, browser floor and edit checks green; its reachable-tests step ran the whole suite (the retained check_records.py is Python outside the mapped roots) and hit the 1800 s limit under load. The reachable selection without that file (179 files) ran 5080 passed, 13 failed: 6 contiguity, 2 fixed_core_packet reaping tests that fail on clean main here, 2 n11 and 2 validation_cli tests that pass alone (load), and test_site_frontier_table's pinned n = 51 value, fixed in 2bcc69791. Renumbered to T-088/T-089 in a scratch worktree, check_results and 93 register tests pass.

2026-10-05 04:00Z blind review (separately prompted reviewer, commit 64d710577, not pushed): docs/project/reviews/review-2026-10-05-wand125-october-4-certificates.md accepts T-090 and T-091 (28 certificates) with no blocking defect; OF-1..OF-5 non-blocking. OF-2: five T-091 bundles (n53, n54, n58-L7935, n70-L86575, n88-L962) record their proof run on macOS arm64 (Python 3.14.7, NumPy 2.5.3); the replay receipts should name that platform, and the x86-64 replay must return those records exactly (n58-L7935 index 197 did, 587 s here). Spot replays: n58-L7935 index 197 and n88-L96125 index 92 from regenerated inputs, both returned their records. T-091 now V0/C1 (external_review on its 12 report entries, reviews entry covers T-090 and T-091, next_rung = replays only). S3 confirmed. Records tier fails only id contiguity.
