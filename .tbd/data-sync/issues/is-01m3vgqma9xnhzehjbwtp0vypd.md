W2 Session165: independent parse ignores coordinates.origin and square_size. A container-center unit witness with side2 and local corners(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1) can pass [0,2] geometry while main shifts it and rejects. Require supported rational-corner lower-left/right-up/unit semantics, meaningful differential regressions, retain existing controls. Source half-angle adapter emits canonical semantics; no n17 target was run before discovery.
