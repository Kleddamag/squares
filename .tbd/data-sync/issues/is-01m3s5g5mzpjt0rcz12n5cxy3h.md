The final center and capture replays currently write their detailed receipt only at exit. Process liveness is visible, but phase/step/row progress and estimated remaining work are not, which impedes efficient supervision. Add low-overhead diagnostic progress at completed owner/node boundaries, with wall and CPU accounting separated from acceptance. Progress must never be reusable proof authority; final source rechecks, complete inventories and contradiction/endpoint joins remain required. Preserve frozen in-flight implementations: this follow-up must not restart or delay the current n11 proof jobs. Measure overhead and test timeout/failure reporting with small controls before adoption.
