No GitHub review exists on #305. Run one senior engineering review of the branch diff against main (correctness of the T-007 re-grounding, register/evidence consistency, tool code, tests, CI wiring), then one pass addressing every finding.

## Notes

Review by tbd-strong 2026-10-04 at 498258a9f: no blocking; should-fix: (1) check_nagamochi_bounds two-sided tolerance accepts rounded-up verified floors; (2) deferred checkpoint never completed on the PR (dispatch at post-merge head), gate-budgets.yaml cites wrong run id 37101062051 vs 37101088102; (3) tautological Karakus ordering check in check_nagamochi_lemma1_counterexample cited as evidence. Nits: piercing survey float compares; T-007 audit step touches misses inputs; D-516 regression: none; review doc silent on Bentz 2010 L7(ii)/2016 L2 imports; Lean receipt partial rebuild.
