  title: wand125 Tools Review and Native Rectangle Verification
  date: '2026-09-29'
  started_at: '2026-09-29T07:07:55.005Z'
  branch: codex/wand125-tools-review
  primary_bead: think-8cps
  status: stopped
  goal: Cite wand125's maintained tools repository, register and review its claims without promoting
    unsupported bounds, implement an independent native rectangle verifier with retained controls,
    and document actual verification coverage and remaining gaps.
  workflow_phases:
  - workflow: factual-review
    focus: correctness
    recording: retrospective
    objective: Pin the new source, separate its claims, and review the mathematical and admission
      contracts.
    status: completed
    entered_by: session_start
    switch_reason: null
    budget_minutes: null
    started_at: null
    deadline_at: null
    expected_output: Source packet, claim registrations, mathematical review and reproducible findings.
    validation_command: null
    kill_condition: null
    fallback: null
    outcome: Pinned square-packing-tools at 0d33ab61726c2ab03e3eb8f457dabaf22db8571f, registered
      T-056 and T-057 with their evidence limits, and reproduced an upstream wrapper announcing false
      s(1) >= 1.5 after coverage passed with mass 28.9.

    - docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-29-wand125-tools-mathematics.md
    stop_reason: Intake evidence and review findings retained; no frontier bound promoted.
    next_action: Build the missing independent rectangle-coverage capability under think-bmf3.
  - workflow: pipeline-improvement
    focus: correctness
    recording: retrospective
    bead: think-bmf3
    objective: Build a native exact rectangle-density verifier and test its proof and admission boundaries.
    status: completed
    entered_by: user_request
    switch_reason: The coverage audit found rectangle replay still depended on the upstream C++ checker.
    budget_minutes: null
    started_at: null
    deadline_at: null
    expected_output: Exact coverage library, CLI, refusal tests, reviewed contract and bounded receipts.
    validation_command: null
    kill_condition: null
    fallback: null
    outcome: Implemented exact rational clipping and centre-domain subdivision independently of verify.cpp.
      The analytic density passed all 201 angles; the over-budget source input was refused; the retained
      n11 probe was inconclusive at its work cap. Parallel review strengthened direct-API admission,
      exact-number and net checks, receipt binding, parser limits and incomplete-run statuses.

    stop_reason: Prototype and controls retained; complete external-certificate coverage remains
      open.
    next_action: Retain that performance and coverage limit and follow the next bounded W7 plan.
  - workflow: documentation-pass
    focus: correctness
    recording: retrospective
    objective: Make maintained upstream repositories and verifier trust boundaries discoverable to
      readers.
    status: completed
    entered_by: evidence_checkpoint
    switch_reason: The source review and native controls supplied the facts the reader-facing overview
      needed.
    budget_minutes: null
    started_at: null
    deadline_at: null
    expected_output: Maintained-repository references, verification overview and accurate synopsis
      pointers.
    validation_command: null
    kill_condition: null
    fallback: null
    outcome: Added the maintained-repository reference structure and a verification-tooling overview
      covering packing witnesses, points, thresholds, parent cores, rectangle densities, mixed covers
      and formal-kernel boundaries. Updated SYNOPSIS, kept TUTORIAL unchanged as requested, and documented
      the native prototype's complete control separately from its inconclusive external probe.
    evidence:
    - docs/project/verification-tooling.md
    - packing/resources/README.md
    - SYNOPSIS.md
    stop_reason: Reader-facing descriptions reconciled with retained evidence.
    next_action: Finish validation, resource accounting and the PR publication checkpoint.
  - workflow: documentation-pass
    focus: process
    recording: retrospective
    objective: Reconcile session provenance, measured cost, validation and publication status at
      the terminal checkpoint.

    switch_reason: Finalization found the missing durable session contract and OR-9 cost block.

      publication handoff.
    validation_command: null
    kill_condition: null
    fallback: null
    outcome: Reconstructed the earlier W2/W7/W8 history without inventing contemporaneous clocks.
      Retained measured Codex task-tree cost. Focused 97-test validation passed. The push gate passed
      51 of 82 selected steps in 889.62 seconds, including 2003 passed and 6 deselected reachable
      behavioral tests in 842.01 seconds. The full PR checkpoint and publication remained pending.

    - packing/campaign/resource-usage/session-162-codex-task-tree.yaml
    - packing/campaign/agent-sessions/session-162-wand125-tools-intake.md
    stop_reason: The implementation/review block ended with explicit certification and publication
      debt; no final gate success is claimed.
    next_action: 'Coordinator continues think-8cps: retain the passed push gate, run or collect a
      qualifying fast/full checkpoint at the committed source, publish and monitor the PR; then clear
      certification debt.'
    bead: think-8cps
  budget:
    wall_minutes: 60
  stop_conditions:
  - Do not promote T-056 or T-057 beyond their retained evidence.
  - Treat native caps and partial angle runs as incomplete, never as a proved external bound.
  - Close the initial slice with an explicit certification debt rather than infer a passing full
    checkpoint from focused tests or the narrower push gate.
  progress:
    metric: Citable source claims and reusable independent verification with explicit evidence boundaries.
    before: New tools source uncited; its claims unreviewed; full rectangle coverage depended on
      upstream verify.cpp.
    after: Pinned and cited tools source; T-056/T-057 registered with explicit limits; exact native
      rectangle prototype and controls retained; no external bound promoted.
  delegations:
  - task: Mathematical source and native geometry review.
    operator: proof_review, GPT-6 Astra
    status: completed
    recording: retrospective
    outcome: Reviewed transformation and coverage arguments, retained the false-bound negative control
      and kept sample scope explicit.

# Session 162 — wand125 Tools Review and Native Rectangle Verification

The initial W2 review, W7 implementation and W8 documentation slice is closed.
Certification and publication remain with the coordinator under `think-8cps`; the native
verifier’s next bounded work remains open under `think-bmf3`. Focused validation
reported 97 passing tests.
The coordinator reported the push gate passing 51 of 82 selected steps in 889.62
seconds, including 2003 passing reachable behavioral tests and 6 deselections in 842.01
seconds. No fast/full checkpoint or publication success is claimed.

This record was reconstructed at finalization.
The task start and terminal checkpoint are observed; internal phase and delegation
timestamps were not retained as session contracts and remain null.
The phase rows reconstruct the deliverables and their logical handoffs, not
contemporaneous declarations or disjoint parallel-lane intervals.
The required `budget.wall_minutes: 60` is an administrative allocation recorded during
finalization, not evidence of an original timebox.
No historical deadline is invented.

The resource receipt uses root task tree `01a0ebfc-3542-7181-b3e5-beeea16215c2` from
`2026-09-29T07:07:55.005Z` through `2026-09-29T07:46:23Z`. Its live-snapshot flag makes
it a lower bound on the ongoing conversation.
Publication work after the cutoff belongs to a subsequent interval if retained.
Branch attribution is operator-declared because the Codex harness does not record Git
branches; raw logs stay outside the repository.

The source wrapper’s false `s(1) >= 1.5` announcement is a reproduced admission defect,
not a refutation of the rectangle coverage computation.
The native analytic control verifies all 201 angles; the retained n11 probe remains
inconclusive. T-056’s ceiling and T-057’s full row census retain the limitations in the
mathematical review.
