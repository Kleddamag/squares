Answer jlevy/squares#227 (franciscouzo, opened 2026-09-23): 102 and 103

Replies due, from `python -m devtools.check_requests --report` on 2026-10-02:
- a follow-up: the reply of 2026-09-29 said the intake and the review are linked on the branch claude/determined-goldberg-ura2ed
- a follow-up: the reply of 2026-09-30 said the interval route is linked on the branch claude/determined-goldberg-ura2ed; the import is on main (jlevy/squares#248 and #249)
- a follow-up: the reply of 2026-09-30 said jlevy/squares#249 is not merged yet; it has merged
- couzo-49: the reply of 2026-09-30 stated T-056 at V4/C4; it is now V3/C3

Closeable now: yes, with a final comment.
Close condition: A follow-up states V3/C3 under the ladder of 30 September and links the review and the interval route on main. Nothing Couzo asked for is then queued: the three trailing cases at n = 206, 259 and 305 need poses only the author can supply.

Sequence: once the pull request holding the ids above is on main, from packing/ on main run `uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.check_requests --draft 227`; the owner posts it (or an agent at the owner's request); record the comment's URL, date, kind and reported state under the issue's `replies` in packing/campaign/result-requests.yaml; rerun --report and close the issue with a final comment when it says closeable. Import beads: none yet.
