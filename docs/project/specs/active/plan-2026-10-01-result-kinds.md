# Plan: A Kind for Every Registered Result

**Date:** 2026-10-01

**Author:** Claude (agent), for the repository owner

**Status:** Proposal for the owner’s confirmation.
The classification below is applied on the branch so it can be read as a diff; changing
a result’s kind is an edit to one line of `results.yaml`.

**Workflow:** W7 pipeline improvement

**Beads:** `think-69j0`

## Summary

The results register holds 61 results, and they are not all the same sort of thing.
Most are lower bounds on $s(n)$. Some are upper bounds, some settle an exact value, and
a few are neither: a rigidity proof, the exclusion of one branch of a case analysis, an
erratum to a published lemma.
Until now the record had one label for a result whose evidence claims no bound.
Its standing read “not a bound”, which says what the result is not.

The owner asked for every result to be classified by what it is, starting from four
kinds: lower bound, upper bound, optimality and simplification.
This plan proposes ten kinds, the owner’s four and six more, and assigns one to each of
the 61 results. Each result carries its kind in a required `kind` field, the checker
cross-checks the field against the claim and the evidence where it can, and the views
that printed “not a bound” print the kind instead.

## The Vocabulary

Each kind is named for what a result of that kind establishes.
The first four are the owner’s.

| Kind | Stored as | A result of this kind | Results |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| lower bound | `lower-bound` | proves $s(n) \ge v$ or $s(n) > v$: no packing of $n$ unit squares fits in a smaller square | 37 |
| upper bound | `upper-bound` | proves $s(n) \le v$ by a verified packing of $n$ unit squares in a square of side $v$ | 4 |
| optimality | `optimality` | settles an exact value $s(n) = v$: a lower bound that meets an upper bound | 6 |
| simplification | `simplification` | proves again a result the record already holds, by a shorter, cleaner or more elementary route, and moves no bound | 2 |
| rigidity | `rigidity` | says whether one named packing can move at fixed side: its flexes, its rigidity at first or second order, the isolation of its pose | 3 |
| case exclusion | `case-exclusion` | shows that one named class of configurations (a branch, a corner class, a region of pose space) holds no packing at a stated side, and moves no bound by itself | 3 |
| restricted optimality | `restricted-optimality` | finds the best packing within a declared family, such as fixed orientation classes near one pose, and says nothing about $s(n)$ outside it | 1 |
| method limit | `method-limit` | says how far one proof method or construction can reach: a ceiling on what a point set or a certificate format can certify | 2 |
| correction | `correction` | shows that a published statement is false as printed, and gives the corrected statement that holds | 1 |
| audit | `audit` | checks an existing proof or certificate independently and finds it correct as published | 2 |

The field is named `kind`. No result-level field had that name; a review record inside a
result has its own `kind` (adversarial, oversight and so on), which is a different
object and is untouched.

## How One Kind Is Chosen

Every result gets exactly one kind.
Three rules settle the cases where two kinds fit.

1. **The kind is what the claim concludes.** Where a claim ends in a bound or a value of
   $s(n)$, the kind is that bound, however it was reached: by a repaired proof (T-010),
   by an exact check of a published packing (T-011), or by monotonicity from another
   result (T-002, T-016).
2. **A lower bound that meets a known upper bound is optimality.** The claim states the
   value, so the kind does.
   T-051 is a cover that proves $s(32) \ge 6$, and the grid gives $s(32) \le 6$; the
   result is $s(32) = 6$.
3. **A second proof of a value the record holds is a simplification, not a second
   optimality.** What such a result adds is the route.
   Its claim names the result it proves again.

One field is enough.
No result needed a secondary kind once these rules were applied: the claim text carries
the second reading where there is one (T-006, below).

## The Classification

The claim column is each result’s headline.
Confidence is high where the kind follows from the claim’s own relation or wording, and
medium where another kind was a reasonable choice; those ten are discussed in the next
section.

| id | n | claim | kind | why | confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-001 | 17 | $s(17) \ge \frac{4426213}{1000000} = 4.426213$, from a sixteen-point unavoidable set | lower bound | the claim concludes $s(17) \ge$ | high |
| T-002 | 18 | `s(18) ≥ 4426213/1000000`, by monotonicity from T-001 | lower bound | T-001 carried to 18 by monotonicity | high |
| T-003 | 17, 18 | The sixteen-point set’s unavoidability ceiling lies in $[\frac{4426213}{1000000}, \frac{4427}{1000})$ | method limit | brackets what one point set can certify; its lower end is T-001 | medium |
| T-004 | 46 | Bentz 2010, Theorem 8 ($s(46) \ge 7$) is correct as printed, machine-audited in full | audit | the claim is that a printed proof is correct; T-008 carries the value | medium |

## Where the Choice Was Not Obvious

- **T-054 and T-055: simplification or optimality.** Both claim an exact value,
  $s(45) = 7$ and $s(21) = 5$, that T-053 and T-052 already hold, and both sources say
  so and claim no priority.
  What they add is a certificate in a narrower language: weighted points alone, where
  the first proofs needed mass on grid-line segments, and for T-055 a positive margin
  where the first proof had none.
  They are proposed as simplifications.
  The alternative is to call them optimality and let the derived standing, *second
  certificate*, carry the rest.
  The weakness of the proposal is that “simpler” is a judgment and “second” is a fact; a
  second route that is different without being simpler would need the same kind or a new
  one.
- **T-006: one entry, two things.** The entry is $s(13) = 4$, Bentz’s theorem of 2010,
  and it also records Evan Daniel’s proof of the same value without a case analysis,
  checked in Lean. The value is primary, so the kind is optimality.
  The second proof is a simplification that has no entry of its own.
  Splitting the entry is outside this change.
- **T-004: audit or lower bound.** The claim is that Bentz’s printed proof of
  $s(46) \ge 7$ is correct, and T-008 carries the value $s(46) = 7$ built on it.
  By rule 1 the kind is audit, since the conclusion is about the proof.
  The alternative reading is that the entry is Bentz’s lower bound, with the audit
  recorded by its `V` and `C` rungs as it is for every other replayed result by others.
- **T-011: upper bound or audit.** The claim is that Trump’s 1979 packing is exactly
  valid, “so $s(11) \le$ that side”.
  The conclusion is a bound, so the kind is upper bound.
  T-004 and T-011 are close, and the owner may prefer to treat them alike.
- **T-010: lower bound or correction.** Stromquist’s printed argument for
  $s(11) \ge 2 + 4/\sqrt{5}$ does not close, and this result proves the bound with a
  repaired point set. The claim concludes the bound, so it is a lower bound.
  T-005 is the correction proper: its claim is that a printed lemma is false.
- **T-003 and T-058: method limit.** T-003 brackets the largest side one sixteen-point
  set can certify; its lower end is T-001’s bound and its upper end is an escaping pose.
  T-058 is a source’s claim that rectangle certificates with one core side cannot pass a
  stated side. Neither bounds $s(n)$. T-058 is reported and disputed, and its kind says
  what is claimed, as a reported lower bound’s does.
- **T-035: case exclusion or a reduction.** It shows that every small packing in one
  orientation family lies near Trump’s pose, which excludes the rest of that family’s
  pose space. It is proposed as a case exclusion, the kind read broadly.
  A separate kind for reductions would hold this one entry.
- **T-036: restricted optimality.** It proves that Trump’s pose is the best packing in
  one orientation family, with the equality case.
  It is not optimality, because it says nothing about $s(11)$, and calling it a case
  exclusion would hide what it concludes.
  It is the only result of its kind.
- **T-059: audit.** A source reports that its own checker reproduces every row minimum
  of the certificate behind T-037. It proves no bound and is not a second proof of the
  theorem, so it is an audit of a certificate, as T-004 is of a printed proof.

## What the Checker Derives and What It Takes on Declaration

`devtools.check_results` requires the field and its vocabulary, as the schema does, and
cross-checks the declared kind against three things the record already holds.

| Source | What it settles |
| --- | --- |
| The headline’s opening relation | A headline that opens with a relation on $s(n)$ states its kind: `≥` or `>` is a lower bound, `≤` or `<` an upper bound and `=` optimality; only a simplification may open with one under another kind. 44 of the 61 headlines open this way |
| The relations written elsewhere | A bound’s headline writes no relation of the other direction, and its claim writes one of its own if it writes any. An optimality result writes $s(n) = v$. A rigidity, a case exclusion and a restricted optimality write no relation on $s(n)$ in their headline |
| The cited evidence’s `claim` | A lower bound cites lower-bound evidence, an upper bound upper-bound evidence, and optimality an exact value or both halves. A rigidity, a case exclusion and a restricted optimality cite `derived-structure` evidence |
| The results the claim names | A simplification’s claim names a registered result that shares one of its cases |

Method limit, correction and audit are declared and reviewed, not derived: nothing in
the record distinguishes them from each other.
The checker’s tuple, the schema’s enum and the table in `epistemics.md` are held to the
same list by a test.

## What Replaces “Not a Bound”

A result’s standing is derived from the case records: *current best*, *superseded*,
*second certificate*. It is a statement about bounds.
Nine results cite no bound evidence, and their standing was “not a bound” on the site
and a dash in `RESULTS.md`: T-012, T-013, T-014, T-023, T-031, T-035, T-036, T-058 and
T-059. Each now shows its kind where the standing would be: rigidity, case exclusion,
restricted optimality, method limit or audit.

`RESULTS.md` gains a kind column in both tables.
The site’s tables are being rewritten on another branch, so this change touches them
only where the old label was produced; the standing chip and the standing filter show
the kind for those nine results.

## Decisions for the Owner

1. **The vocabulary.** Ten kinds, with one result each in `correction` and
   `restricted-optimality`. Merging `correction` into `audit` would give nine; the
   proposal keeps them apart because an erratum tells a reader that a printed statement
   is wrong.
2. **Simplification.** Whether T-054 and T-055 are simplifications, as proposed, or
   optimality results whose standing says they are second certificates; and whether a
   second route that is not simpler should share the kind.
3. **Audits of published work.** Whether T-004 is an audit, as proposed, or Bentz’s
   lower bound; and whether T-011 should follow it.
4. **T-035.** Case exclusion read broadly, as proposed, or a kind of its own.
5. **Standing for a result that is not a bound.** The standing slot shows the kind for
   now. Once the site shows the kind as its own chip, that slot can be left empty for
   these results.
6. **Two standings that read oddly beside a kind.** T-003 (method limit) stands as
   *superseded* and T-005 (correction) as *current best*, because standing is derived
   from the evidence an entry cites and both cite evidence a case bound rests on.
   The derivation is unchanged here.
   Deriving standing only for the three bound kinds would make both show their kind.

## What Is Left for the Site

- The kind as a chip or a column in the results tables and the result popover.
- A kind filter in the shared filter bar, beside Standing.
- The standing chip and filter no longer carrying kinds, once the kind has its own
  place.
