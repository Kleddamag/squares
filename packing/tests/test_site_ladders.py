"""The rating ladders hold their rows at every width, in a browser.

Verification Ladders is one diagram of three ladders (`templates/paper-design.md`,
Rating ladders): every rung is the same height, a chip and a description that is a box of
exactly two lines its words never run past, with no tally of results and no rule between
the rows. Whether a text takes two lines is the browser's to say, from the face and the
cell's width, so this opens the rendered results page in Chromium (the diagram was the
overview's until 2026-10-02) and measures the diagram
with the probe `devtools.measure_site_pages ladders` reports from, at the widths the
design is shot at and at the ones where a description is narrowest: 716 pixels, the least
window that sets three columns, and 715, where the ladders stack; 768, where the page's
margin widens and the wide track is 4 pixels more than at 716; 980, the least that sets
a rung's description beside its chip in three columns, and 979, the widest that sets it
under; and on a phone 360 and 320, the least that sets it beside, with 319 under. At
each the diagram also stands inside whatever clips the page sideways, with the wide
track's gutter either side.

The page is rendered and loaded once, in a module fixture, and resized for each width.
Skipped where no Chromium can be launched; `SQPACK_CHROMIUM` names one the environment
supplies, as the other browser tools read it.
