# Measure-Verifier Performance Campaign

**Question.** How much less CPU than the authors’ `verify.cpp` does the clean-room
verifier [`sqverify-fast`](../../sqverify_fast/) need to reach the same verdicts on the
wand125 rectangle-density certificates, and which changes to it earn their keep?

This is lane W2 of the independent fast measure verifier (`think-gpe0`, campaign bead
`think-tgra`). Soundness comes first: [SOUNDNESS.md](../../sqverify_fast/SOUNDNESS.md)
states the lemmas every change must keep, and an experiment whose verdicts differ from
the control’s on any benchmark cell is invalid, whatever its speed.

## Subject and Instance

The subject is one `sqverify-fast` build on this repository’s shared Linux container (4
cores, load average 18 to 33 during series 001, from other lanes), against the unchanged
`verify.cpp` compiled by the replay tool with `g++ -O2 -std=c++17
-fno-fast-math -ffp-contract=off`. The instance axis is the benchmark cell: one standing
certificate at one net direction, threshold $10001/10000$ (the authors’).

The fixed cells, declared in `benchmarks/bench_measure_verifier.py` before any
experiment, are `rect_n32_L595`, `rect_n61_L796` and `rect_n78_L8955` (1,080, 3,000 and
6,496 expanded rectangles) at $r = 1, 50, 100, 150, 200$, and `rect_n95_L98418` at $r =
1, 100, 200$. Direction $r = 0$ is reported separately: the two programs use unrelated
algorithms there and one ratio would swamp the rest.

## Metric Vector

| Metric | Role | Measured by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instructions in the direction search (`search_instructions`: inclusive cost of `rotated::verify_direction`), summed over the callgrind cells `n32@r1`, `n32@r100`, `n61@r100` | outcome | `--callgrind` (valgrind `Ir`), independent of load |
| Instructions per process, the same cells | outcome for admission changes; cost otherwise | the same run |
| CPU seconds per process (user plus system, `wait4`), total of per-cell medians | guard | interleaved runs, arm order rotated each repeat |
| Verdict of every cell | guard | must equal the control’s; any difference invalidates the round |
| Nodes per cell | mechanism | the verifier’s receipt |
| Load average before and after each run | regime | `/proc/loadavg` |

Wall time is recorded and never decides: the host’s load stayed above 6 throughout.

## Accept Rule

Declared 2026-10-02T18:01Z, after exp-002’s instruction counts for H-001 had been seen
and before any other candidate was measured; the outcome metric was narrowed to the
search’s own instructions at 19:55Z, after exp-002 showed that admission diluted process
totals, and before exp-003 was measured.
A candidate is **accepted** when, against its control (the standing best build):

1. every benchmark cell it ran has the control’s verdict;
2. its outcome metric (the search’s instructions, or the process’s for a change to
   admission) is at least 10% lower; and
3. its CPU total of medians, over at least two interleaved repeats of the cells both
   ran, is not higher than the control’s.

Otherwise it is **rejected** and reverted, and recorded either way.
Clause 3 is a guard against an instruction count that buys nothing on the hardware; it
does not let a CPU reading override the instruction count, since the load makes CPU time
noisy. The one judgment written beside the arithmetic is whether a change is worth its
complexity.

## Runbook

1. Build the candidate (`cargo build --release` in `packing/sqverify_fast`) and copy the
   binary aside under a label.
2. From `packing/`, run the callgrind cells for control and candidate:
   `python -m benchmarks.bench_measure_verifier --arm fast:control=PATH --arm
   fast:candidate=PATH --callgrind --repeats 1 --cells
   rect_n32_L595@r1,rect_n32_L595@r100,rect_n61_L796@r100 --out results/exp-NNN-cg.jsonl`.
3. Run the CPU cells, interleaved: the same with `--repeats 2` and no `--callgrind`.
4. Apply the accept rule; write `experiments/exp-NNN-*.md` with the numbers lifted from
   the JSONL, and commit the raw results with it.
5. For the headline comparison against `verify.cpp`, replay whole certificates:
   `python -m benchmarks.bench_measure_verifier --arm fast:candidate=PATH --arm
   verify-cpp --whole rect_n32_L595,rect_n31_L592 --out results/whole.jsonl`. Both arms
   then do all 201 directions on one worker, `verify.cpp` through the replay tool’s
   `--replay --workers 1` (its CPU includes the tool’s exact preflight and the compile,
   a few seconds). Per-direction cells against `verify.cpp` use `--arm
   verify-cpp` without `--whole`. The replay tool’s control mode refuses some directions
   before running the checker (its mutation premise does not hold there); those cells
   have no reference reading.

The coordinator runs the headline comparison on a dedicated idle runner with the same
script; this campaign’s CPU readings were taken under load and are the ratio’s local
estimate only.

## Standing Results

The standing build is c7b: c2 (exp-003, exp-004 and exp-005 accepted on v0) with the
sampled release audit (exp-014, +3.4%), Milestone B’s points, segments and fresh
classification audit (exp-015, +1.4% on rectangle certificates), and the fixes for the
soundness review’s findings, which make `NaN` fatal (exp-017, −1.0%). On this loaded
host c2 used 43 times less CPU than `verify.cpp` on the whole of `rect_n32_L595`
(exp-006) and 29 times less on six single directions (exp-011).

Milestone B adds points, segments and formats M and L. Against the authors’ recorded
replays, at all 201 directions on a host with load average 4 to 5, `sqverify-fast` used
758 CPU seconds on `mixed_n76_L894` (format M; the replay used 13,096, 17 times more)
and 128 on `mixed_n101_L1028` (format L; the replay used 27,669, 216 times more), and
3.5 seconds at the linear certificate’s direction zero, where the replay spent 950. All
six replayed mixed and linear certificates verify at all 201 directions; on the single
directions replayed for the other four, the replay used 22 to 29 times more CPU. The
per-certificate table is [census-mixed/README.md](census-mixed/README.md).

Eight hypotheses were rejected: H-001, H-005, H-008, H-004, H-009, H-010, H-011 and
H-012. The three first-leg rounds (exp-009, exp-010, exp-016) found a real 27 to 37% cut
in boxes that costs as much again in enclosures, eagerly, lazily or fused with the box’s
own; it pays only with a cheaper predictor of the boxes that need it.
