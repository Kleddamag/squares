"""Backfill each register entry's `registered` date from the history of `results.yaml`.

A result's registration date is the author date of the first commit that added its
`id: T-NNN` line to the register, which `git log --reverse -m -S` finds. The `-m` is
load-bearing: `T-032` entered the register in a merge's conflict resolution, and a
pickaxe that skips merge diffs finds no commit for it at all. The Pages build
cannot read history (its checkout is sparse and shallow), so the date is written into
the record once, here, and reviewed as data like any other field; afterwards a new
entry carries its date from the start and this tool has nothing left to do.

It inserts a `registered:` line after the `id:` and `kind:` lines of every entry that
lacks one and leaves every other byte of the file alone, so the diff is the backfill and
nothing else. An entry the history does not know yet (added in the working tree and not
committed) is dated today. An entry that already carries a date is never rewritten.

Usage, from `packing/`:
    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.backfill_result_registration
    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.backfill_result_registration \\
        --apply
