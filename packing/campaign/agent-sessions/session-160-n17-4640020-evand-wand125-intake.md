  goal: >-
    Get PR 235 green and mergeable, take in the collaborating repositories' newest n = 11
    and n = 17 work and anything else they published since the last intake, have Fable
    max review every new argument before it is registered, and queue the overnight CPU
    work that the new bounds make worth running, as a pull request stacked on PR 235.
  workflow_phases:
  - workflow: factual-review
    focus: correctness
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    objective: >-
      Retain and replay Kleddamag's v1.1.0 (s(17) > 232001/50000), evand/square-packing
      (s(32) = 6, s(12) >= 15680/3951, s(21) >= 5000/1001), wand125's rectangle
      certificates for n = 18 to 78 and Guzhou0806's R052 continuation; review each new
      argument with Fable max; register what epistemics.md derives.

      Retained packets with receipts, dated reviews, register entries and case records,
      and README and SYNOPSIS credits.
    validation_command: >-
      cd packing && uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev packing-validate --records
    kill_condition: A replay fails or a review finds a gap the certificate does not close.
    fallback: Record the claim as reported but unverified, with the finding.
    outcome: >-
      Kleddamag's s(17) > 232001/50000 is the verified n = 17 bound at V4/C3: both
      source checkers passed here in 2,204 s and a Fable max review found no defect.
      Daniel's s(32) = 6 is proved at V4/C1 and s(12) >= 15680/3951 and s(21) >=
      5000/1001 are verified at V4/C3, after a Fable max review found no defect. wand125's
      rectangle certificates raise 42 reported lower bounds and three verified ones
      (n = 27, 28, 31) after complete replays, and a Fable review found the reviewed
      checker's premises unchanged at their sizes. Guzhou0806's 4.62003 continuation is a
      superseded publication record with an exact C++ replay receipt.

    focus: insight
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    objective: >-
      Decide what 4.640020 and the new external bounds make worth an overnight CPU
      budget at n = 11, n = 17 and the weakest other n, from a Fable max assessment and a
      Fable check of its lemma.
    status: completed
    entered_by: user_request

      The owner asked for a deeper mathematical push, especially CPU-bound overnight work
      that could confirm remaining research blocks or improve n = 11, n = 17 or other n.

    outcome: >-
      The plan queues BC-390 (rung 0 widened), BC-394 (rectangle ladders at n = 82 and
      50) and BC-395 (n = 12) tonight and builds BC-393 (the native C4 route for
      4.640020), BC-388 and BC-387 by day. A Fable check proved the clique-weighted
      capacity-one lemma, placed the ceiling in [4.640020, s(17)], and withdrew the
      plan's +0.006 side cap as unestablished. BC-386 stops in favour of BC-393 and BC-391
      is retired.

      all 2,168 rows. s(12) reaches V4/C4 through this repository's native parent-core
      route, and s(32) = 6 reaches V4/C3 on a complete re-sweep of all 7,200 roots. Credit
      lines name people and lineage, never AI agents; the project is credited as Squares
      Project (Levy). The video process is documented in the workbench README with a
      poster tool, and large retained certificate data is stored as deterministic gzip.

# Intake of Kleddamag’s 4.640020, Daniel’s s(32) = 6 and wand125’s Rectangle Bounds

On 2026-09-26 and 27 three collaborating repositories published results the record did
not hold: Kleddamag’s $s(17) > 232001/50000$, Daniel’s $s(32) = 6$ with new bounds at
$n = 12$ and $n = 21$, and wand125’s rectangle certificates for $n = 18$ to $78$. The
owner asked for PR 235 to be made mergeable, for this work to be taken in on a stacked
pull request, and for the overnight CPU work it makes worthwhile to be queued.
This session retains each source, replays it, has Fable max review it, and registers
what the evidence supports.
