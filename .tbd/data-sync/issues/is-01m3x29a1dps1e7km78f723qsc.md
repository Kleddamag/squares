Handoff of the website lane (epic think-xjq4) at 2026-10-02 01:35 UTC, 18:35 PT on 1 October. Read this first, then the beads it names.

**Merged on 1 October, all deployed:** #254 #255 #261 #262 #264 #265 #266 #267 #269 #270 #271 #274 #275 #276 #277 #278 #284 #285 #286 #287 #288 #289, and #291 (v0.5.0) as 8aaa411dc. The deployment of 07f014386 was verified (check_published_site 848 of 848; homepage, both papers and the atlas Triangle view read in a browser). The deployment of 8aaa411dc was running when this was written.

**In flight**

1. think-pt1k, v0.5.0: verify the deployment of 8aaa411dc, record it above PUBLICATION_HISTORY, then bring the tag and GitHub release to the owner. Steps and commands are in that bead's notes.
2. think-f1tu (children think-sv92, think-ekw5, think-dj7y), the Overview restructure: a subagent on branch claude/overview-structure in worktree overview-result-pop; a draft PR is to be opened by it. Review it, mark it ready and merge when clean.
3. think-sib7, P1 bug: main's post-merge validate job fails eleven table-layout tests on Linux at 07f014386, on both attempts of run 36943941580. They pass on macOS and the live site is unaffected. Main shows red until this is settled; the bead has the evidence and three steps to decide it.
4. think-t7k5: record suite_d's first measurement and rebuild the shard cost record from a green four-shard main run; the pending rule expires 2026-10-08.

**Owner decisions outstanding:** one list on think-cv22 (credits of T-025/026/031/033/009; status vocabulary and T-065's credit; result kinds; nav bar name; page titles and social card; tables below 1280; the review paper's version line, first-published day and repository line; whether PDFs and Videos sits right after the survey). Plus the v0.5.0 tag and release, and the wording of v0.5.0's scope sentence.

**Not this lane's:** #283 (research), #290 and #292 (the result import process) belong to other sessions and were not touched.

**How things work here** (also in the memory file project-site-pr-stack-2026-10-01): `gh pr merge N --merge` for a plain PR and `gh stack merge <top> --yes --merge` for a stack; `gh run rerun <id>` with no `--failed`; never change packing/pyproject.toml; data-path commits re-pin with `devtools.release_pin --update`; subagents on `model: fable` until the Opus limit resets on 4 October 23:00 PT; scratch on /Volumes/spud-ext1/agent-scratch (about 20 GB free). Housekeeping of worktrees and branches: think-d5l5.

**Follow-up beads still open from the day:** think-gv85, think-dda6, think-irsg, think-54rr, think-c4as, think-9y87, think-k8xp, think-3qn8, think-zb0i, think-b245, think-h896.

## Notes

Update 2026-10-02 02:40 UTC (19:40 PT, 1 October), superseding the "In flight" list above where they differ.

- v0.5.0 is live: 8aaa411dc deployed at 2026-10-02T01:07:03Z; every page prints v0.5.0-971e5f. #297 recorded the deployment above PUBLICATION_HISTORY and merged as 0848631a8. Main's runs at 8aaa411dc are green. Left on think-pt1k: the owner's tag and GitHub release, and the scope sentence's wording.
- think-f1tu, the Overview restructure: the external drive dropped at about 01:30 UTC and killed the first subagent. Its uncommitted edits were recovered when the drive returned and saved as fa4eef763 on origin/claude/overview-structure (WIP, unreviewed). A second subagent works on the internal disk in /Users/levy/wrk/github/squares/.claude/worktrees/overview-restructure on branch claude/overview-restructure and was told to merge that commit and finish; a draft PR is to appear on that branch.
- think-sib7, main's eleven failing layout tests on Linux: a subagent is diagnosing it in worktree audit-main on branch claude/validate-layout-tests, with a draft PR to come. Known so far: the PR suite shards install no Chromium, so those tests may never run with a browser on a pull request.
- Sparse worktree .claude/worktrees/v050-deployment (branch claude/v0.5.0-deployment, merged) can be removed.

Update 02:55 UTC: think-pt1k is closed. The owner said GitHub releases matter only for generated assets (PDFs, films), so the v0.5.0 tag and release are not pending; the procedure text that still asks for them at every bump is tracked separately (see the newest child of think-xjq4 titled "Release procedure…"). The Overview restructure has a draft PR, jlevy/squares#299 on claude/overview-restructure; its agent was still running gates.

Update 03:15 UTC. Three subagents are running, each to a draft PR that the coordinator reviews, marks ready and merges:
1. think-f1tu: jlevy/squares#299 (claude/overview-restructure, internal worktree .claude/worktrees/overview-restructure). Its first hosted run failed typecheck on preview_site.py:589 (color_scheme typed str); the agent was told. Gates and shots were still pending.
2. think-sib7: branch claude/validate-layout-tests in worktree audit-main; no PR yet.
3. think-rgvr with think-be7y: papers individually versioned, and the release procedure without a routine tag and release; branch claude/paper-versions in worktree overview-papers; no PR yet. The owner's words are on think-rgvr.
Possible overlap: #299 and the papers PR both edit render_overview.py (the papers one only the colophon); merge #299 first and have the other merge main.

Update 05:30 UTC. Merged since the last note: jlevy/squares#299 (Overview restructure, 0b2fa368b, deployed and read live) and #300 (think-sib7 fixed: headless-shell font hinting on Linux; the two table-layout files now run in the PR frontend job; 8dbd2a77b). think-sv92, think-dj7y, think-sib7 and think-pt1k are closed. New follow-up: think-hatf (the other thirteen browser-backed test files still skip on pull requests).
Still running: (1) think-ekw5 follow-up, branch claude/recent-results-lead in .claude/worktrees/overview-restructure, Recent Results on the Overview down to one compact paragraph; no PR yet. (2) think-rgvr with think-be7y, branch claude/paper-versions in worktree overview-papers on the external drive; no PR and no pushed commit at 05:00 UTC.

Update 06:10 UTC. Merged: jlevy/squares#302 (Recent Results on the Overview as one paragraph, b75b08f99). think-ekw5 and think-f1tu closed; the restructure lane is finished and its open choices are on think-cv22. One lane left: jlevy/squares#301 (draft, claude/paper-versions, worktree overview-papers on the external drive), think-rgvr with think-be7y. Its code and tests are done and its hosted run was green at 139e64c33; pending in the PR: development.md and paper-design.md, the first paper's PDF page count with a three-entry history, shots, and a merge of main after #302. Its edition table: v0.3.0, v0.4.0 and v0.4.2 kept as published; v0.4.1 and v0.5.0 dropped (the article did not change). Owner question from it: the article changed in substance after the v0.4.2 deployment (T-060's settlement) under the v0.4.2 label; is that a new version of the paper, and under what number.

Update 07:00 UTC. Merged: jlevy/squares#301 (papers individually versioned; release procedure without a routine tag or release) as 4030cb43b. think-rgvr and think-be7y closed. No lane is in flight and no PR of this lane is open. Deployment of 4030cb43b was running; verify with `check_published_site --commit 4030cb43bd91f064143e3d6b493fdff8a1941c6c` from packing/ in a worktree at origin/main.
What is left is the owner's list on think-cv22 (new from #301: whether the first paper's changes since v0.4.2 are a new version of the paper and under what number; the poster's site stamp visible inside the paper's Figure 2; whether the site's edition history is shown anywhere on the site), think-hatf (thirteen browser-backed test files still skip on pull requests), think-t7k5 (suite_d's recorded measurement, due 2026-10-08), think-d5l5 (housekeeping of worktrees and merged branches), and the older follow-up beads listed in the description.

Update 07:15 UTC. One lane reopened by an owner answer: think-1qk8, the first paper becomes v0.4.3 (a patch revision for its changes since the v0.4.2 deployment). The papers subagent works on branch claude/explainer-v0.4.3 in worktree overview-papers; a small draft PR is to come (gh pr list --head claude/explainer-v0.4.3). Review, mark ready, merge when green.
