The original documentation-selection audit found WALKER_MARKERS substring matches for attack strings, importlib.metadata.version, temporary-directory-only globs and comments. Preserve actual repository walkers and dynamic imports, add positive and refusal controls, and measure selected files before narrowing. This is separate from worker scheduling and hosted fanout; do not claim it fixed by parallel execution.

## Notes

Session164 Sol bounded implementation: AST walker evidence now excludes comments and the exact benign from-importlib.metadata version import; real glob/listdir and dynamic import uses remain selected, and all old marker-bearing string literals remain conservative (including attack/alias/helper execution). Same retained frontier-path probe changed 82/387 to 81/388 selected after adding one dedicated regression test file; independent scan found only two existing walker-selection removals: test_change_scoped_selection.py (comment), test_command_help.py (metadata). Focused 43 tests pass; Ruff and BasedPyright clean. Broader gate and speed effect unmeasured; root owns integration.
