"""Find, and write, the sentence each case record owes a source that says AI assisted it.

epistemics.md, Results by Others: "Where a source states that AI assisted its work, its
case record and the README say so in the source's own terms." The bibliography notes
record each source's statement, but a case record is hand-written prose, and on
2026-09-29 some fifty of them cited wand125's or Tokoharu's releases in their front
matter without saying so in their bodies. Writing one sentence into each by hand is the
one-off edit `OR-1` asks to be a tool, and checking that none is missing afterwards is
the measurement that should outlive it.

Each `Statement` names the bibliography keys whose citation calls for it, the paragraph
that describes that source's result (`anchor`), the sentence to write there in the
source's own words, and the words that show the paragraph already says so (`marker`).
A record owes the statement when its front matter cites one of the keys and a body
paragraph matches the anchor; it has it when such a paragraph contains the marker.
`--apply` appends the sentence to the first anchored paragraph of every record that
owes one; the Markdown formatter then reflows it.

Records whose body never describes the source owe nothing and are listed by `--check`
as such, since where the sentence belongs is then a question for the record rather than
this tool. Statements that differ release by release, as `n-017`'s five successive
external bounds do, are written by hand and are not in `STATEMENTS`.

**The Kingbird catalogue states AI assistance entry by entry**, a different sentence at
each count that carries one ("Found by Joost de Winter in August 2026, working with
unspecified AI, ..."), so it is not a `Statement` either. A record whose reported side
is the catalogue's owes every AI statement of the entry it transcribes -- the current
capture's, or the earlier one's at a count pending intake -- quoted whole, and
`--check` holds it to that (`catalogue_owed`).
`devtools.generate_frontier_case` writes those quotations into the packing paragraph of
the records it drafts, which above `n = 100` is all of them; `--apply` does not write
them, so a hand-written record that comes to owe one fails `--check` until its author
places the sentence.

Usage, from `packing/`:

    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.state_ai_assistance --check
    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.state_ai_assistance --apply
    ... --below 68    only the records n < 68
