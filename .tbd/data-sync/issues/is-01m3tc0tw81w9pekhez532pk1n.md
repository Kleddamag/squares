Owner, 2026-09-30: every table row that has a hover must not use individual cell expansion. The whole row takes the hover, is clickable (and keyboard-focusable, Enter/Space to open), and opens one popover for that row, the same popover component the cards use. Make this the design system's one pattern for detail on a table row, documented in paper-design.md, and apply it to every site table with row detail: Recent Results on the homepage, all-results.html, and any other table that expands a cell today (overview_sections' <details> in the result cell; the replay table). Without scripts, the row's detail stays reachable (a link to its record or a visible fallback).
