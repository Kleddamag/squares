close_reason: "Done: the SVG toolkit spec landed in PR 25 (merged 2026-08-25, 05888b60f), sqpack.render is on main, and all 14 children, including the three reopened PR 25 follow-ups, are closed."

Implement the plan's zero-dependency deterministic SVG spine, progressive overview/comparison/trajectory views, exact metadata and comments, known-answer n=3 migration, and portability checks. Acceptance is the spec's full criteria: byte-repeatable fixtures, honest evidence labels, safe self-contained SVG, useful static fallbacks, measured size/render cost, and a green repository gate.

## Notes

Planning is in PR #25, stacked on PR #24 through commit 15aad42. The active spec includes the official-library survey, exact file/function map, CSS reduced-motion fallback, deterministic metrics split, n=5 fixture ownership, and an 11-child dependency graph. The full 30-step packing gate passed with 42 negative controls; implementation remains open and begins at think-5681.

Reopened: Post-close review found three unresolved PR #25 soundness, validity, and porting children. Reopening the owning epic preserves the work and restores a truthful bead hierarchy; it must remain open until those children are resolved.
