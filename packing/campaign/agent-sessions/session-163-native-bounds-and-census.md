  primary_bead: think-8cps
  status: stopped
  goal: Advance independently reviewed native rectangle verification and trustworthy T-057 row admission,
    preserve exact evidence and mapped remaining obligations, and integrate validated slices on PR 246.
  workflow_phases:
  - workflow: pipeline-improvement
    focus: correctness
    recording: contemporaneous
    clock_role: work
    objective: Establish readiness of exact frontier/corner-bound and T-057 provenance/census tools, then
      execute the predeclared bounded comparison only after independent review.
    status: completed

    deadline_at: '2026-09-29T17:57:04Z'
    expected_output: Reviewed exact controls, bounded diagnostic/comparison receipts and strict row-census
      admission tests.
    validation_command: cd packing && uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev pytest -q tests/test_rectangle_density.py
      tests/test_rectangle_density_cli_golden.py tests/test_general_pose_tree_census.py
    kill_condition: Any unsound bound, identity mismatch, incomplete frontier or false complete verdict
      stops target measurement.
    fallback: Retain the refusal or incomplete evidence and repair the instrument before starting a new
      measurement phase.
    outcome: Native exact frontier and corner mode reviewed; 21 native/golden tests pass. Frozen nine-box
      comparison completed but produced zero new threshold crossings. Separate 1,000-node probe is inconclusive
      with 67 depth-capped and 11 queued boxes. T-057 production-bound wrapper passes 10 controls and
      fresh 3-row partial replay.

      the interrupted run passed.

    outcome: >-
      The final local push tier passed all 51 selected steps and 2,289 reachable tests
      in 742.30 seconds. Commit 132c209c0 published the reviewed source, receipt and
      records. Main advanced while this work was in flight, so the hosted branch became
      unmergeable and normal PR checks were withheld pending conflict resolution.
      The refinement remains a local diagnostic: 15 of 67 parents close after 268
      children; no complete external native rectangle replay or T-057 row census is
      claimed.

    - packing/resources/web/wand125-tools-2026-09-29/receipts/native-n11-depth22-refinement.json
    stop_reason: >-
      Main advanced after publication and before a qualifying hosted gate could run on
      the mergeable branch. The unresolved upstream merge and final-head certification
      are tracked under think-niqx.
    next_action: >-
      Under think-niqx, merge current main, regenerate derived records and atlas, run
      required local and hosted checks, then clear certification debt only on a
      qualifying final-head pass.

    max_cycles: 6
    orientation_minutes: 10
    checkpoint_minutes: 20
    slice_minutes: 30
    finalization_minutes: 20
  stop_conditions:
  - Do not promote any external certificate without complete admitted coverage.
  - Do not run a target measurement before instrument readiness and the frozen comparison criterion.
  - Preserve input identity, exact arithmetic and incomplete/refused verdicts.
  progress:
    metric: Reviewed implementation slices and complete versus partial evidence
    before: Native analytic control complete; retained n11 frontier unresolved; T-057 has three unbound
      legacy sample rows and no strict census wrapper.
    after: >-
      Reviewed exact native controls and a strict T-057 census wrapper were published.
      The bounded native external probes and two-level refinement remain partial: 15
      of 67 refined parents close, 52 do not, and 11 original frontier boxes are queued.
      T-057 source row equality has been replayed for 3 of 12,028 rows. A 51-step push
      gate passed at 132c209c0, while the later upstream conflict leaves hosted
      certification pending under think-niqx.

    status: completed
    recording: contemporaneous
    outcome: Readiness approved before target execution. Subsequent receipt review confirms all 67 parents,
      268 partitions, exact monotonicity and closure flags, 15 closures and all five source/input hashes.
      The reviewer did not recompute clipping bounds; findings were saved before the lane reached a usage

  resource_rollups:

  stop_reason: >-
    The reviewed diagnostic and final local push gate were retained and published, but
    upstream changed before hosted certification. This session stopped with the exact
    integration debt under think-niqx; the remaining mathematical proof obligations
    stay open under think-aqne and think-11z6.
  next_action: >-
    Under think-niqx, merge current main and certify the resulting PR head through
    required local and hosted checks. The mathematical obligations identified above
    remain separate after this integration debt is discharged.

# Session 163 — Native Rectangle Bounds and T-057 Census Admission

Entry: W7 pipeline improvement from the Session 162 handoff.
Initial delegation and source inspection preceded this clocked integration interval;
they are not invented as measured work inside it.
The phase contracts govern the remaining work from the recorded start.
The coordinator retains source and evidence; scratch is on the external volume.

The active plan maps every scoped gap to a bead.
Two Sol implementation lanes own disjoint files; Astra at max thinking owns mathematical
and verifier review.
No registry promotion is authorized by a passing engineering slice.

Future slices are maximum allocations, revised from evidence: finish instrument and
contract review; run the frozen bounded comparison; decide whether measured cost
supports a larger replay; integrate tests and records; publish and review CI. Each work
slice is at most 30 minutes.
A renewed phase gets a new contract; no deadline or failed criterion is changed
retroactively. The final 20 minutes are reserved for closeout and publication.

The first comparison criterion is recorded in the native verification plan before target
measurement. Raw exact receipt values determine its verdict.
Wall time from one run is diagnostic evidence only, not a performance claim.

The wand125 claims recorded here under provisional T-056/T-057 are registered as
T-058/T-059 after integration with the published Couzo and de Winter claims.
The historical labels and retained receipt bytes are unchanged.
