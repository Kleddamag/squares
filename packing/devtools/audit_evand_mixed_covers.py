"""Audit the mixed covers for ``s(n)``, n = 21, 45, 59, 60 and 77, independently.

A *mixed cover* is point masses plus mass spread uniformly along axis-parallel segments
of the grid lines, of total below ``n``, such that every closed unit square in
``[0, s]^2`` captures mass at least one. Two checkers by Daniel, ``zm_mixed.py`` and
``zmx2``, decide that coverage by subdividing pose space. The covers and records live in
three packets under ``resources/web/``:

- ``evand-square-packing-2026-09-28/``: ``s(21) = 5`` and ``s(45) = 7``, both checkers'
  records, this repository's replays, and the ``zmx2`` runs on the point covers ``13``
  and ``32``;
- ``evand-square-packing-2026-10-01/``: ``s(60) = 8`` with both checkers' records, and
  the ``s(32)`` point cover's ``zmx2 --full --pair-points --sym-atoms`` log;
- ``wand125-point-and-mixed-2026-10-01/``: wand125's ``s(59) = 8`` and ``s(77) = 9``,
  whose ``zmx2`` logs and ``zm_mixed.py`` per-root records are not published, only the
  ``zm_mixed.py`` manifests.

This tool decides, with its own parser and exact integer arithmetic, the facts that do
not need a sweep, and re-reads the sweeps' records without the source's summarisers:

``cover``
    The file is mixed format v1 with no polygons. Every coordinate lies in ``[0, s]``,
    every mass is nonnegative, every segment is axis-parallel with positive length, and
    the total is the stated fraction and below ``n``. The measure is invariant under
    ``x -> s - x`` and ``x <-> y`` in two senses, both decided: entry by entry (points as
    a weighted multiset, segments as unordered endpoint pairs), which is the hypothesis
    of the source's Lean lemma ``MixedCover.d4InvM``, and as a measure (point masses by
    position, segment mass as a piecewise-constant density on each line). It also counts
    the points lying on a line that carries segment mass, of which a clean cover has
    none, and reports the census of segment lengths.
``zmx2``
    A ``zmx2 cert`` log covers exactly the region its mode names, once per root, with no
    uncertified and no capped box. The root grid is derived from the side: centre cells
    of pitch 1/10 over ``[0, s/2]^2`` (``d4``) or ``[0, s]^2`` (``full``, for pass 0, the
    cover, and pass 1, its mirror ``y -> s - y``), by four ``u`` bins of width 1/8 over
    ``[0, 1/2]``. Each ``ROOT`` line must be exactly as ``zmx2`` writes it, with the id
    ``zmx2`` numbers that root with; every header must name the mode and carry no field
    this tool does not know (a later ``zmx2`` appends ``umin``, which leaves angles out,
    and ``area``). The header's ``atoms`` field is reported as flags (``pair_points``,
    ``sym_atoms``, ...), and ``--atoms`` requires a value. Both header versions are read:
    ``zmx2.rs`` ``6b7f0f79``, and ``92a4cfe8``, which appends ``+sym`` under
    ``--sym-atoms``. Several logs are read as one record, and one file may hold several
    runs joined end to end: region runs (``--xlo``/``--xhi``/``--ylo``/``--yhi``/
    ``--bins``) made apart and joined. Then every header must be the same apart from
    ``region``, each run's roots must lie in the limits its own header names, and the
    union must hold every root of the region once; ``joined`` and ``runs`` say how the
    record was made. For ``s(59)`` and ``s(77)``, whose logs are not published, the box
    totals the source's README states are reported beside the audit, as are the
    ``atoms`` the source ran with. ``--case`` also takes the source's point covers,
    ``13`` and ``32``, whose ``d4`` logs must in addition reach the totals
    ``search/ZMX2.md`` section 9 reports.
``zm-mixed``
    A ``zm_mixed.py --resume`` record file names the checker files and cover by SHA-256,
    carries the certificate-mode D4 settings, covers exactly the root grid of pitch 1/20
    over ``[0, s/2]^2`` by sixteen ``u`` bins of width 1/32, once per root, and has no
    uncertified box. The file defaults to the source's complete run where it is
    published (``21``, ``45``, ``60``). With ``--deep``, a *composite*: the complete run
    may leave boxes uncertified, and is clean only if every root holding one is
    certified, whole and without an uncertified box, by a deeper run of the same checker
    files, cover and settings apart from ``depth`` and ``region``, itself complete over
    its region. The report says whether the files are the ones the source's manifests
    name by digest; a replay's are not, as they carry its own CPU times.
``zm-mixed-manifest``
    What a ``zm_mixed.py`` manifest states, read without its per-root records: checker
    and cover digests, settings, the number of roots against the region the settings
    declare, the census, the verdict, and whether the records are retained. It exits 0
    only if the manifests state a whole-region verification with no uncertified box,
    and its ``verdict`` is ``stated verified``, ``undecided`` or ``not clean``. For
    ``s(59)`` it is ``undecided``: the complete depth-24 run states 6 uncertified boxes,
    and a depth-34 run states the one root ``R = [27/20, 7/5] x [13/10, 27/20] x
    [1/4, 9/32]`` certified. Which roots hold the 6 boxes is written only in the
    complete run's per-root records and log, neither published, so whether ``R``
    contains them cannot be decided from the manifests; the report lists what they do
    decide, and the command exits 1. With the records, ``zm-mixed --deep`` decides it.
``compare-zmx2``, ``compare-zm-mixed``
    Root for root, a replay's census equals the source's record of the same root, timing
    fields excepted. Source roots the replay did not run are counted, not failed, so a
    sample or a partial re-sweep compares as cleanly as a complete one. A ``zmx2``
    replay may be several logs or joined runs; its headers must equal the reference's in
    every field but ``region``, which a joined or partial replay legitimately names
    differently (``not_compared`` says why; ``headers_identical`` compares whole lines),
    each root must appear once, and its ``UNCERT`` lines must match the reference's.
    The default reference is the source's log (``21``, ``45``, ``60``; for
    ``32 --mode full`` its ``--sym-atoms`` run) or, for the point covers' ``d4`` runs,
    this repository's retained run. For ``59`` and ``77`` the source publishes no log,
    so a reference must be named.
``check``
    All of the above on the retained files: the five covers; the shipped records and
    receipts of ``21``, ``45`` and ``60``, and the source's ``zmx2`` manifests of ``60``
    and of the ``s(32)`` ``--sym-atoms`` log, whose log digest, line counts, header and
    totals must be the audited log's; the retained ``zmx2`` runs on the source's
    ``s(13)`` and ``s(32)`` point covers, which must be present and whose totals must
    equal the ones ``search/ZMX2.md`` reports; and the manifests. What the retained
    files cannot decide (``s(59)``'s composite) is listed under ``undecided`` and is not
    counted clean or failed.

Usage (from ``packing/``)::

    uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.audit_evand_mixed_covers check
    ... audit_evand_mixed_covers cover --case 77 [PATH]
    ... audit_evand_mixed_covers zmx2 --case 60 --mode full --atoms grid OUT/roots.log
    ... audit_evand_mixed_covers zmx2 --case 77 --mode full --atoms pairpts A.log B.log
    ... audit_evand_mixed_covers compare-zmx2 --case 32 --mode full --records OUT/roots.log
    ... audit_evand_mixed_covers zm-mixed --case 60
    ... audit_evand_mixed_covers zm-mixed --case 59 OUT/roots.jsonl --deep DEEP/roots.jsonl
    ... audit_evand_mixed_covers zm-mixed-manifest --case 59
    ... audit_evand_mixed_covers compare-zm-mixed --case 21 --records OUT/roots.jsonl

Every command prints JSON and exits 0 when the audit is clean, 1 otherwise. Files stored
as deterministic gzip are read through `devtools.retained_data.read_retained_bytes`, so a
path may name ``X`` or ``X.gz``; a path naming ``X.xz``, or ``X`` beside it, is read with
`lzma`. Every digest is that of the decompressed bytes.
