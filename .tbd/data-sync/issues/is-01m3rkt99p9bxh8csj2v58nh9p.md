Hosted run36684000513 at6c1c713af passed all logical checks but failed cost controls: checks127.39s against75.67s baseline (1.68x), suiteB153.34s and two reachable-graph tests12.97/12.93s above12s. Previous4c826f8 run36683159180 passed. Separate runner variance from repository corpus/graph growth using existing hosted receipts; improve measured hotspot without weakening thresholds or delaying T060 geometry. One same-head failed-job replay is authorized as diagnosis; no broad local suites.

## Notes

At b6c97667b run36735084578, all suite-B 4408 behavioral tests passed but wall165.06s exceeded154s (1.60x102.91 baseline); A passed. The live wall fix worked and reported conservative265s, then correctly refused the failed prerequisite. Sol compares multiple same-cohort shard profiles to select a durable repartition or extra parallel shard without weakening coverage or budgets. This is integration cost debt, not a mathematical gap.
