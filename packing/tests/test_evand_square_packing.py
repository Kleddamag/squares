"""Controls for Evan Daniel's certificates, retained from ``evand/square-packing``.

The packet under ``resources/web/evand-square-packing-2026-09-26/`` holds the source's
bytes; the replays that decide coverage take minutes to hours and leave receipts. These
tests are the fast part that has to stay true: the retained bytes are the pinned ones,
each certificate is well formed with nonnegative weights, is exactly invariant under
the container's symmetry group, and weighs less than the count it excludes, and the
frontier records carry exactly the side each certificate's header states.

Coverage itself, every closed unit square capturing weight at least one, is not decided
here: that is the source checkers' sweep, replayed in the packet's receipts.

The large certificates, run records and receipts are stored as deterministic gzip; every
read goes through `read_retained_bytes`, so each digest checked is the upstream one.
