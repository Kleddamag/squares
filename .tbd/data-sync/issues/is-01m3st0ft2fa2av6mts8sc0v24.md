close_reason: "Preregistered bounded full-verifier comparison completed and independently audited by Astra: 12 exact matched reports; external child CPU median -14.4927%, invocation wall median -17.8519%, prereg criterion met. Receipt SHA8518e1a3; external angle1 remains INCONCLUSIVE, no production switch or proof credit. Adoption and remaining performance work stay with parent think-i5x7."

Follow the completed 12.912% fixed-primitive ablation in PR251 with a source-bound production-default versus experimental-coprime comparison on the retained external angle1/1000-node workload. Use the complete201-angle analytic fixture and malformed/source/deadline controls for correctness. Freeze sources, build flags, effective cutoff, traversal, node counts, timing metrics and accept rule before three alternating pairs. Require identical normalized reports; capped external runs remain INCONCLUSIVE and earn no certificate credit. Report coordinator CPU, child CPU and wall separately. Adopt only if the measured benefit justifies the small canonical helper; do not conflate this with a GMP/library comparison. Keep GCD/operand-size/allocation profiling and one alternative engine as separately measured hypotheses under parent think-3cwg.

## Notes

Frozen prereg before trials at source SHAef07125f, tests SHA5141a2b0: analytic n3 all201/1781 VERIFIED and external n11 angle1/1000 INCONCLUSIVE, threshold1/common-core, 3 alternating default/coprime pairs, exact historical normalized report SHA on every run, supervised inner30/outer40/total300; any mismatch/refusal/timeout zero comparison credit. Material bounded-verifier criterion external Rust child CPU median<=90% default with nonoverlapping ranges, external wall median<=105%, analytic wall median<=105%. Two setup preflights failed before trials (module import, --no-default-features old-artifact hash); both recorded zero trials. Final actual default cargo build --offline --locked --release recorded SHA0a8714df/toolchain/source/flags in preflight log and receipt; coprime d25afa bound prior receipt95247e0c.

External invocation wall median11.742820→9.646504s, 17.85% lower, paired0.83657/0.80222/0.97124; wall ranges overlap slightly so do not claim uniform wall improvement.

Preregistered bounded criterion met, but external remains INCONCLUSIVE and no complete n11 certificate, proof credit or production default change follows.
