// One change of the atlas's layout, timed. `press` is the selector of the control that
// makes it, a view tab or the expander. The control is pressed once two frames have
// passed, and the report is made once every tile's move has finished and two frames
// more have passed. It gives: how long the press's own handler ran, which is the whole
// of the script's work (both reads of every box, the change and starting the moves);
// how many tiles moved; how long the move lasted from the press; the animation frames
// the page was given in that time, the longest and the mean interval between two, and
// how many intervals were over one and a half frames of the display's rate, which is a
// frame the main thread missed; and every long task, over 50 ms, with its length. An
// animation frame is an opportunity to paint on the main thread, not a presented frame:
// the moves themselves are transforms the compositor draws without it.
//
// Asking for an animation frame makes the main thread produce one, and with it restyle
// every tile in a move, which it otherwise leaves to the compositor. So with `frames`
// false no frame is asked for while the tiles move, and the browser's own counters over
// the change (`measure_atlas_views.timed`) show what the main thread does when nothing
// is watching it; the frame numbers are then all zero.
