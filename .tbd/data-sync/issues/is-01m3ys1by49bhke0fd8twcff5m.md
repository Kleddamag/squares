Answer jlevy/squares#256 (evand, opened 2026-09-30): Exact value s(60) = 8 (corollary s(61) = 8): registration request (external certificate)

Replies due, from `python -m devtools.check_requests --report` on 2026-10-02:
- an acknowledgement: nothing has been posted on this issue
- s60: T-062 at V3/C3: confirmed, and no reply has said so
- s61: T-063 at V3/C3: confirmed, and no reply has said so

Closeable now: yes, with a final comment.
Close condition: T-062 and T-063 are confirmed, and the reply saying so is posted from main.

Sequence: once the pull request holding the ids above is on main, from packing/ on main run `uv run --frozen --all-extras --group dev python -m devtools.check_requests --draft 256`; the owner posts it (or an agent at the owner's request); record the comment's URL, date, kind and reported state under the issue's `replies` in packing/campaign/result-requests.yaml; rerun --report and close the issue with a final comment when it says closeable.
